# ludics-lite

A small collection of agent skills for landing work through review and running
delegation waves over an issue backlog across a fleet of machines. They are the lightweight,
skill-only companion to [ludics](https://github.com/lukstafi/ludics): no binary, no daemon,
just Markdown and shell loaded by compatible agent harnesses from their skill directories.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ship-pr` | Land finished work: decide between a direct push and a PR, then carry the PR through automated review to merge, with a watcher that survives reviewer delays. |
| `wait-and-proceed` | Block a task behind another branch or PR until it lands, then continue. |
| `after-merge` | Right after a merge, brainstorm what the experience suggests about the codebase and route each idea to an issue, a task chip, or the bin. |
| `issue-wave` | Run one coordinator over the whole fleet: pick issues from a sequencing plan, launch one worker per issue in its own worktree on a chosen box, and supervise the wave to full merge. |

The skills were extracted from a private repository with their full history. Its issues were
cloned here and the references in the skills renumbered to `ludics-lite#N`; the few remaining
`self-improve#N` references, and the ones in older commit messages, are that repository's pull
requests, which were not cloned. They are kept as provenance.

## Installing

Clone the repository and symlink each skill into `~/.claude/skills`. Symlinks rather than copies
mean a skill edited mid-session lands in this working tree and shows up as a normal `git status`,
so there is no separate sync step to forget.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukstafi/ludics-lite.git ~/ludics-lite
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/skills"
for s in "$HOME"/ludics-lite/*/; do
  case "$s" in */.git/) continue ;; esac
  ln -sfn "${s%/}" "$HOME/.claude/skills/$(basename "$s")"
done
```

Rerun the loop after adding a skill. Replace any pre-existing real directory in
`~/.claude/skills/` by hand first, and diff it against this copy, since a divergent local edit
may be a fix worth keeping.

Keep these `~/.claude/skills` links even on a Codex-only box: command examples use them as the
canonical script paths. The `~/.codex/skills` links below are additionally required for Codex to
discover the skills.

On a machine that runs Codex workers (see the Codex workers section of `issue-wave/SKILL.md`),
also link the skills Codex uses into `~/.codex/skills`. The issue-wave coordinator's per-launch
preflight (`issue-wave/scripts/fleet-worker.sh preflight <box> --codex`) refuses to launch a
Codex worker on a box where these links are missing:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.codex/skills"
for s in ship-pr wait-and-proceed after-merge; do
  ln -sfn "$HOME/ludics-lite/$s" "$HOME/.codex/skills/$s"
done
```

A box that runs the `issue-wave` coordinator itself under Codex needs that skill discoverable too:

```sh
ln -sfn "$HOME/ludics-lite/issue-wave" "$HOME/.codex/skills/issue-wave"
```

## Fleet configuration

`issue-wave` assumes a fleet of boxes reachable over ssh, with one anchor box that holds the
lease and halt files. Every site-specific value is an environment variable read by
`issue-wave/scripts/fleet-worker.sh`; the header comment of that script is the authoritative
list. The ones you will need to set for your own fleet:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `FLEET_BOXES` | Space-separated fleet box names. |
| `FLEET_ANCHOR` | The box where the lease and halt files live. |
| `FLEET_LOCAL_BOX` | This box's fleet name, if hostname detection does not recognise it. |
| `FLEET_HOSTNAME_MAP` | How hostname detection reads: space-separated `<glob>=<box>` pairs, first match wins. |
| `FLEET_BASE_REF` | The ref a worker's worktree starts from when a launch names no `--base` (`origin/master` by default). |
| `FLEET_SKILLS_REPO` | Path of this checkout on each box, `~/ludics-lite` by default (the preflight fast-forwards it). |
| `FLEET_FLOTILLA` | URL of the flotilla status service, if you run one. |
| `ISSUE_WAVE_STATE` | Local state directory for each coordinator. |
| `FLEET_ANCHOR_STATE` | State directory on the anchor for the lease and fleet-wide halt; every coordinator must resolve it to the same directory there. |

The defaults encode the author's fleet and will not work anywhere else. The prose of
`issue-wave/SKILL.md` names that fleet too, along with a daily sequencing plan file and the
project the waves run over; its opening "Site configuration" section lists what to edit.

`ship-pr` assumes the [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) GitHub app reviews every PR: its
watch waits for that reviewer's rounds and its 👍 reaction is the approval gate. Without it, the
watch reports that no review is coming and the merge gate has only the build signal to read.

Before every launch the preflight fast-forwards the target box's checkout of this repository to
upstream main and refuses on a dirty or diverged checkout. That pull-side step is what
propagates merged skill edits to boxes that slept through the merge. A headless worker also
needs the box's CLI logged in: `claude auth login` for Claude workers (an expired OAuth session
cannot refresh headless, and `claude auth status` does not notice) and `codex login` for Codex
ones. The preflight proves both with a live call, not a status read.

## Tests

The shell scripts carry their own test suites:

```sh
issue-wave/scripts/test-fleet-worker.sh
ship-pr/scripts/test-post-merge-cleanup.sh
```

## Why symlinks, not copies

Copies drift silently, and did: the `ship-pr` watcher was independently repaired on a second
machine against a base that had already grown a better fix, so the repair both duplicated work
and sat on top of a copy missing later improvements. Symlinks make one tree the only tree.
