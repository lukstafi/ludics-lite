# Claude Code coordinator, CLI workers

A CLI worker is a headless `claude -p` or `codex exec` turn in a detached tmux session on a
fleet box, launched and supervised through `fleet-worker.sh` by a coordinator of either
provider. This file is written for a Claude Code coordinator, and its workers can be Claude or
Codex invocations (`--kind claude` / `--kind codex`); the shared issue requirements of the
brief, the base gate and the preflight are in SKILL.md, and the handoff for a worker that
cannot message the coordinator is the [CLI reservation handoff](executions.md#cli-reservation-handoff).

## Launch

CLI workers use `~/.claude/skills/issue-wave/scripts/fleet-worker.sh`. Each is a detached
tmux session on its agent box running the selected `claude` or `codex` CLI, with the brief on
stdin and events, stderr, exit code and session id under
`~/.local/state/issue-wave/workers/<name>/`. Detached CLI workers run without permission
prompts: retain the triage screen of the full issue body and comments before launch. Issues
with untrusted outside participation are deferred or handled under ordinary permission
controls, not dispatched unscreened.

Write the brief to a file and launch with the selected kind (`--kind claude` with `-- --model
opus --effort high` for requested Opus, or `--kind codex` with the user's supported Codex model
flags):

```bash
fleet-worker.sh launch <box> <repo>-<issue> --target-repo <owner/repo> --kind claude --brief <brief-file> \
  --repo '~/<project checkout>' --branch claude/<topic> [-- <model flags>]
fleet-worker.sh attach <box> <repo>-<issue>     # Bash run_in_background: the wake signal
```

`launch` creates `<checkout>-worktrees/<name>` off `origin/master` on the box (`FLEET_BASE_REF`
for another default, `--base` for one launch, `--cwd` for a worktree that already exists) and
prints the session id that addresses every later intervention. `attach` blocks until the
worker's session exits and prints one verdict line (`DONE` / `FAILED` / `VANISHED`), riding out
ssh drops and box naps by retrying from the coordinator's side; run it as a harness-tracked
background task, one per worker, and its completion notification is the wake signal - exactly
the wait-and-proceed shape. A `DONE` line is a returned turn and nothing more (SKILL.md,
Supervise: *A returned turn means the turn ended*): read the final output for a request or a
result before calling the issue finished.

## Blocking in a headless turn

A CLI worker's turn ending is its process ending: `claude -p` or `codex exec` exits, and every
background task it started dies with it, so no watch survives to wake it, no notification or
heartbeat reaches it, and only the coordinator's `unstick` runs it again (2026-09-23: the
ocannl#1032 worker armed `pr-review.sh watch` and a CI wait in the background, ended its turn on
"the watch will wake me", and left an exited session with no watch running; ludics-lite#361).
The brief of every CLI worker carries this, and tells it to block inside the turn on every watch,
wait and suite until the command returns - bounded calls re-issued, never an `until`/`sleep`
loop:

- a Claude worker runs anything that can outlast the 600 s foreground cap under `bg-run.sh`, as
  [native-claude.md, *Blocking on a run*](native-claude.md#blocking-on-a-run) says: `start` as a
  background task, then foreground `wait` calls re-issued in the SAME turn until one prints
  `rc=`. The backgrounded `start` holds the command only while the turn lasts;
- a Codex worker keeps the command in the foreground of its turn, as
  [native-codex.md](native-codex.md#what-a-returned-turn-means) says.

`attach` marks a `DONE` line `PROBABLE STRAND` when the turn's final message announces a wait
still pending (its header lists the phrases it reads); treat it as a returned turn whose watch
is gone, and `unstick` the session with the wait to run in the foreground.

## Supervising

- **The stall test is `fleet-worker.sh status <box> <name>`**: one line with the session's
  liveness, the stream's event count and quiet time, the last event type, and the worktree's
  head age and dirty count. A `codex exec` or `claude -p` run is silent between events and has
  no yield signal, so the test is **stream quiet AND worktree unmoved over a wall-clock window
  sized to the task** (a long test run is quiet on both for its duration; a review round is
  not), read the same way on every box. The machine-level checks of SKILL.md's *Verify
  externally* apply on top.
- **Nothing is stranded by a coordinator interruption; the wave just went unobserved.**
  Detached workers keep running on their boxes, so after any interruption the recovery is
  `fleet-worker.sh ls` across the fleet, then `attach` again per running worker and
  `status`/verdict per finished one. A fleet-length wave (10 h and more) is therefore not a
  heartbeat problem. `attach` itself retries an unreachable box for ~40 minutes before giving
  up (exit 4 - wake the box and re-attach).

## Intervening

- **CLI workers: unstick through the script, and only a dead exec.** Write the imperative
  message to a file (do X now, in this turn, do not yield; never as command-line text - issue
  prose is full of backticks and `$()`) and run `fleet-worker.sh unstick <box> <name> --message
  <file>`. It resumes the recorded session in a fresh detached turn - full context retained,
  same worktree (resume has no `-C`; the script `cd`s first) - and REFUSES while the exec is
  alive, because a resume beside a live exec gives the branch two writers, one of them
  possibly a finisher mid-rebase, and a quiet stream does not prove the exec cannot still act.
  For a live-but-stuck worker pass `--kill`: the script stops the tmux session, waits for the
  CLI process to be gone, then resumes. Do NOT reach for `codex queue --thread <id>
  --message` for an exec worker: an entire `codex exec` run is ONE turn and queued messages
  deliver only at a turn boundary - the message sits undelivered while the worker keeps doing
  the thing you queued it to stop (2026-08-30: a tip-chasing worker ran 50 more minutes past
  its queued stop). Escalation is two failed interventions, then the coordinator takes over
  the mechanical remainder or spawns a Claude finisher on the worktree's branch - after
  `status` shows the stalled session gone. A finisher landing a stalled worker's branch does
  not inherit its transcript, so after the merge `unstick` the ORIGINAL session (post-exit, no
  `--kill` needed) with the hand-back brainstorm prompt - the friction that grounds
  `after-merge` is in that session, on that box, and removal-comes-last has kept its worktree
  alive; only if the session is unresumable does the coordinator brainstorm from the diff and
  say so.
- **CLI model-capacity errors end execs; resume the recorded session.** A CLI worker whose
  `attach` line reads `FAILED ... turn.failed ... "Selected model is at capacity"` (or a Claude
  worker's `is_error=true` on a provider error) is terminal for that turn, not for the session.
  The work is durable (briefs mandate early commits): `unstick` with a disk-first note (trust
  `git log`/`git status` and the PR state over the session's memory; re-run anything whose
  result is not in a file) recovered 2/2 cleanly on 2026-08-30. Expect kills to cluster
  (capacity is global); resume victims as their `attach` notifications arrive.

## Close-out

`fleet-worker.sh ls` must show no `RUNNING` and no `ORPHANED` CLI worker on any box before the
wave closes: an orphan is a CLI still writing after its tmux session died - wait for it, or
`unstick --kill` it, never close out over it. Then, and only then, remove CLI workers'
worktrees on their boxes (`ssh <box> 'git -C <checkout> worktree remove <path>'`), once no
outstanding reservation refers to the checkout. The finished worker records under
`~/.local/state/issue-wave/workers/` can stay as evidence; `launch` refuses to overwrite one
without `--replace`.
