# Post-wave coordination

Read this at wave close-out when task chips use the default **post-wave coordination loop**.
This is a continuation under the same coordinator, not a new coordinator or a background task
chip. Preserve the selected provider/model, transport and execution constraints.

## Build the next task list

Finish the current wave's merges, integration checks, hand-backs and editorial pass first.
Deduplicate the proposals, file the ones that merit issues, and add evidence to existing issues
as usual. The next post-wave contains exactly the remaining non-discarded follow-ups without
their own issue. An item covered by a new or existing issue stays with that issue; do not pull
it into the post-wave. Keep reasoned drops out too. Do not reread the sequencing plan to refill
this list, select unrelated backlog work, or file placeholder issues merely to run these tasks.

Persist the task list and dispositions on the existing board before dispatch. Give each task
a stable local ID (for example `post-1-task-2`), repository, source worker/PR, grounding,
self-contained prompt and acceptance criteria. Preserve completed, issued and discarded
dispositions across iterations and recovery so the loop does not rediscover the same work.

## Run another wave

Apply the regular scope, decision gate, launch, brief, supervision, integration and close-out
workflow to this explicit task list, with these adaptations for tasks without issues:

- Derive dependencies and execution placement from the task's actual requirements and its
  source hand-back. Summarize the next wave and proceed under the selected mode; use the
  existing decision gate for unresolved user-owned choices.
- Use one worker and worktree per task. The coordinator continues to sequence and supervise;
  it does not implement the chips itself. All lease, base, reservation and single-writer gates
  still apply, including the rival-PR check by topic before launch.
- Put the local task ID and full task text in the brief and board where an issue number and
  body would normally go. Record decision-gate recommendations and decisions there too; do
  not send `gh issue` calls or fabricate closing keywords for these tasks. Use the task ID in
  worker names and scratch paths; omit optional issue metadata in tools that provide it.
- Workers ship through `ship-pr` and report the result against their board task. A merged PR
  and verified hand-back close the task without an issue-closing comment. For non-code tasks,
  verify the specified deliverable instead. Workers run `after-merge` in hand-back mode for
  landed work, returning proposals to this coordinator without filing, spawning chips, or
  starting another wave themselves.

After each post-wave, perform the same editorial close-out and build the next list from its
eligible follow-ups. Continue recursively until that list is empty. There is no fixed number
of post-waves and no automatic sweep of the issues filed along the way.

## Close the loop

Keep the coordinator lease across post-waves; persist each completed wave and clean up its
workers/worktrees under the transport's normal ownership checks before the next wave starts.
Recovery reconciles the board, workers, reservations and PRs before resuming the recorded
iteration, just as for a regular wave.

If remaining work needs user input, an external dependency or unavailable execution capacity,
record that gate and continue independent tasks. If none can proceed, report the explicit
residuals and stop instead of repeatedly launching the same blocked work. Honor a user stop
or scope limit. The final report covers all iterations, landed work, filed issues, drops and
residuals; release the lease only after the usual accounting and cleanup are complete.
