# bg-run.sh -- run one command as a background task and block on it in bounded foreground calls.
#
# A native worker has nothing that holds its turn on a background task except a foreground Bash
# call, and that call is capped at 600 s. So a command that can outlast the cap (ship-pr's
# `pr-review.sh watch`, `merge --wait`) runs in the background under `start`, and the worker
# re-issues `wait` in the foreground until it reports the command's exit status
# (issue-wave/references/native-claude.md, *Blocking on a run*). This replaces the two lines of
# hand-copied shell that took three review rounds of races (ludics-lite#354, #357):
#
#   bg-run.sh start <dir> -- <cmd> [arg...]    # run it with Bash run_in_background: true
#   bg-run.sh wait  <dir> [--within <s>]       # run it in the foreground; default 540
#
# <dir> is absolute and FRESH for every run: `start` creates it and refuses one that already holds
# anything. It writes four files there and nothing else:
#   pid  -- this script's own pid, published before the command starts. Publishing it is the
#           claim: it is created exclusively, so of two starts racing on one directory exactly one
#           runs its command;
#   cpid -- the command's own pid, published by the command's process before it execs the
#           command, so a command that outlives a killed wrapper is still seen running;
#           Each pid file carries a second line, the process's start time as `ps -o lstart=`
#           gives it, so a pid the system has since reused for another process is not read as
#           the run's (where ps cannot say, the line is empty and the bare pid stands);
#   log  -- the command's stdout and stderr, and the only file the command's output reaches;
#   rc   -- the command's exit status, published (by rename) after the command returns.
# A start refused over an earlier run that has ENDED (finished, or died) writes `refused` into
# that directory, so a wait there says REFUSED instead of reading the earlier status as this
# run's. A start refused over a run that is still live, or still being claimed, marks nothing:
# that is the run a wait there should report, since the likeliest way to reach it is a duplicated
# or retried `start` of the same command -- marking it would send the caller off to run it again.
#
# `wait` polls every 5 s (BG_RUN_POLL, whole seconds) and returns the first settled verdict, or
# the current one once --within seconds are spent. It prints one line and exits with its code:
#   rc=<n>     0  the command finished; <n> is its exit status (also in <dir>/rc). Exit 0 means
#                 FINISHED, not succeeded: a command may exit with any status, so no exit code
#                 of this script can both carry it and stay distinct from the verdicts below.
#   RUNNING    3  the pid or the cpid is alive and there is no rc yet: re-issue the wait.
#   STARTING   4  no pid yet. A background task that has not published its pid is starting, not
#                 dead. Returned at the --within deadline, or once no pid has appeared for 60 s
#                 of this wait (BG_RUN_START_GRACE): re-issue once, and a second STARTING means
#                 the launch itself failed, so start again in a NEW directory.
#   DIED       5  a pid was published, it and the command are both gone, and no rc was
#                 written: the task was killed before the command returned (the harness does this, ~40 min into a
#                 backgrounded `merge --wait`). It says nothing about what the command saw:
#                 re-arm it in a new directory.
#   REFUSED    6  `start` refused this directory (the reason follows): start again in a NEW one.
# Usage errors exit 2, from either subcommand.
#
# The races this closes, each pinned by test-bg-run.sh:
#   1. a killed task never writes rc: `wait` reads the dead pid as DIED instead of polling forever;
#   2. rc is a file of its own, not a line of the log, so output that quotes `rc=` (a review body
#      does) cannot end a wait;
#   3. a wait that runs before the task has published its pid reads STARTING, not DIED;
#   and a stale directory, whose rc belongs to an earlier run, is refused rather than reused.
#   A run that finishes between the rc read and the pid probe is read as finished: a dead pid is
#   followed by a second read of rc before DIED is concluded.
# And a wrapper killed on its own (not with its process group, as the harness does) leaves the
# command running: its cpid keeps the verdict RUNNING rather than a DIED that would re-arm a
# duplicate beside it.
# What it does not close: a `wait` that runs before `start` has run AT ALL, on a directory an
# earlier run left behind, reads that run's status; `start`'s refusal catches the reuse only once
# it has run. A fresh name per run is the caller's half, and this script cannot check it. Nor a
# wrapper killed alone in the instant between forking the command's process and that process
# publishing cpid: a wait in that instant reads DIED.
#
# Portable to bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash) and GNU bash; the Bash tool's zsh only passes argv.
