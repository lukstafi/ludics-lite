# The fleet half of the issue-wave skill: one coordinator launches workers onto any box in the
# fleet and supervises them there, with the same commands whether the box is the coordinator's
# own machine or a remote one reached over ssh (ludics-lite#4).
#
# Native workers use runtime subagents (or explicitly chosen app tasks); this script supplies their provider-specific native
# freshness preflight and point-in-time gate. Their board is coordinator-maintained (see
# references/native-workers.md); ls/status/attach/unstick below only handle CLI workers.
#
# A CLI worker is a detached tmux session on its box running a headless CLI, with its event
# stream on disk under the box's ~/.local/state/issue-wave/workers/<name>/. Everything the
# coordinator needs later is a file there: the JSONL stream, stderr, the exit code, and a meta
# file naming the kind, the cwd and the session id that addresses every intervention.
#
# The two kinds differ in their input channel (ludics-lite#259):
#   - codex: one `codex exec --json` turn per process, brief on stdin; the process ends with the
#     turn, and `unstick` resumes the thread in a new process (kill-and-resume);
#   - claude: ONE long-lived `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json
#     --replay-user-messages` process (meta `channel=stream-json`) whose stdin is fed from the
#     append-only file input.jsonl, one JSON user message per line, the brief first. A `tail -f`
#     feeder (its pid in feeder.pid) pipes that file into the CLI, so stdin stays open between
#     turns; `unstick` appends a line, which the CLI picks up at its next tool
#     or turn boundary (a message sent mid-turn reaches the model mid-turn: Claude Code 2.1.282,
#     probed 2026-09-26), and `close` kills the feeder, the CLI reads EOF and exits, and run.sh
#     writes `exit`. input.jsonl is the durable log of every message (and interrupt) the
#     coordinator sent.
#     `--replay-user-messages` echoes each message into the stream under the uuid it was sent
#     with, which is how `unstick` and `status` prove delivery.
#   A claude worker's states, from its stream past the current process's start (proc_offset):
#     RUNNING  process up, a turn in progress (the last turn event is not a `result`), or the
#              turn ended with background tasks still listed (their completion starts a turn);
#     IDLE     process up, the last turn event is a `result` and no background task is listed:
#              the turn ended and the worker awaits input;
#     EXITED(n), ORPHANED, VANISHED as for codex: the process is gone (after `close`, a crash or
#              a kill), or tmux is gone with a CLI still running, or gone with no exit record.
#   `exit` is still written only when the process ends, so "finished" means the hand-back turn
#   ended AND the coordinator closed the input. `attach` returns on either: an IDLE worker whose
#   latest `result` follows the CLI's echo of the latest message sent (meta `awaiting`) is an
#   IDLE verdict, and an ended process is the DONE/FAILED/VANISHED verdict as before.
#   turn_offset moves only when a process starts (launch, resume): an append names its message
#   in `awaiting` alone, so there is one key to write and nothing to reconcile if it is cut off.
#   One thing IDLE cannot see: a ScheduleWakeup the worker armed is not in the stream, so an IDLE
#   worker can start a turn on its own; the next `attach` or `status` reads it.
#   `unstick --interrupt` (ludics-lite#424) stops the turn in flight, tool call included, through
#   the same channel: it appends the CLI's own control request,
#   {"type":"control_request","request_id":<uuid>,"request":{"subtype":"interrupt"}}, and waits
#   for the `control_response` naming that request_id (the receipt: the CLI read and honoured it;
#   probed on Claude Code 2.1.284, 2026-09-29). The aborted turn ends in a `result` of its own
#   (`error_during_execution`, terminal_reason `aborted_tools`); a message given with it is appended
#   only after the receipt, so it starts the next turn instead of joining the one being aborted. A
#   plain interrupt, not `cancel_queued`: a message queued before it survives (the receipt lists it
#   under `still_queued`) and runs next. Control lines carry no uuid, so every reader of input.jsonl
#   that counts messages by uuid skips them; a resume drops those a new process would read.
#
# Why the shape is what it is, kept in code rather than skill prose:
#   - the worker's process tree hangs off tmux on ITS box, never off the coordinator's ssh or
#     the coordinator's session, so a coordinator pause, restart or dropped connection strands
#     nothing -- `attach` re-arms against the still-running session;
#   - every prompt (brief, unstick message) travels as a FILE, never as command-line text: issue
#     prose is full of backticks and $() that a shell would expand before the model saw them;
#   - supervision reads are the same commands on every box, so "the JSONL stream is quiet AND the
#     worktree is unmoved" (the stall test for workers with no yield signal) does not assume the
#     coordinator can read the worker's disk directly;
#   - the skill-freshness preflight (ludics-lite#3) runs on the box that will run the worker,
#     because that box's ~/.claude/skills symlinks serve whatever its checkout holds;
#   - `unstick` refuses to resume a session whose exec is still alive: a resume beside a live exec
#     gives the branch two writers, and the quiet stream that prompted the unstick does not prove
#     the exec cannot still act. A live claude worker with its input channel up takes the message
#     by append instead, which is the same process and so no second writer; kill-and-resume
#     (`--kill`, or a process already gone) is the fallback for a wedged or exited one, and the
#     output line says which path ran (APPENDED or RESUMED);
#   - fleet-wide state -- the coordinator LEASE and the stop-the-world HALT -- lives on one anchor
#     box (mac-studio, the always-on controller), never on whichever box the coordinator happens
#     to run on: `claim` takes the lease atomically, every `launch` proves it holds it, and `halt`
#     is a file on the anchor the launcher checks, so "one coordinator" and "launch nothing new
#     after an integration regression" are enforced rather than remembered.

#
# <box> is an ssh destination (rog-nv-linux, minix-amd-linux, tuf-amd-linux), or `local` / this machine's own fleet

#
# Env:
#   FLEET_COORDINATOR: lease identity; defaults to inherited CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID or
#     CODEX_THREAD_ID. Required when the harness supplies neither, because nothing is guessed from
#     the process tree.
#   FLEET_LOCAL_BOX: this box's fleet name; otherwise detected from the hostname.
#   FLEET_HOSTNAME_MAP: space-separated `<glob>=<box>` hostname mappings, first match wins; the
#     default is the author's fleet.
#   FLEET_BASE_REF: ref from which `launch` starts a worktree when --base is absent; origin/master.
#   FLEET_ANCHOR: box where lease and halt live; mac-studio.
#   FLEET_ANCHOR_STATE: anchor state dir; defaults to ISSUE_WAVE_STATE.
#   FLEET_LAB_HOST: box that runs wake-lab.sh and the lab's sweep, whose lock directory holds the
#     lab's lane locks; mac-studio. A measurement on a lab box is refused, naming both, unless it is
#     FLEET_ANCHOR (`local` in either reads as FLEET_LOCAL_BOX), since the registry reads the lane
#     lock in the anchor's own lock directory (ludics-lite#454; the header of lib/ludics/fleetworker/registry.py).
#   FLEET_BOXES: whole fleet; "mac-studio rog-nv-linux minix-amd-linux tuf-amd-linux". `ls` sweeps it minus local.
#     One entry per physical box: the registry refuses a reservation under a roster naming two
#     aliases of one box, read from wake-lab.sh's endpoint map (ludics-lite#395; endpoint_map in lib/ludics/fleetworker/execution.py).
#   FLEET_BOX_CORRECTNESS_SLOTS: `<box>=<n>` pairs, how many correctness executions may share a
#     box (ludics-lite#157); an unnamed box has one. "mac-studio=6" whenever the roster is the
#     default one, beside "rog-nv-linux=4 minix-amd-linux=4 tuf-amd-linux=3" in the same
#     value, whether FLEET_BOXES is unset or exports those same boxes (compared as a word set,
#     ludics-lite#329); empty (one slot everywhere) with a custom FLEET_BOXES. Set, even to
#     empty, it overrides the default either way. `preflight` prints the count per roster box.
#     Measurement stays exclusive.
#     Six, not three (ludics-lite#160): three `-j 4` batches ran side by side on the Mac without
#     a stall on 2026-09-15 and the Developer Tools exemption removed the XProtect tax, and the
#     cap exists to bound concurrent load, never to bound how many agents may be in flight.
#     The native GPU boxes' counts were measured with 1-4 concurrent targeted batches, each box
#     under an exclusive reservation (ludics-lite#316 on 2026-09-23, #344 on 2026-09-24), and
#     every batch compiled the tree (dune's cache restored nothing). OCANNL's tools/box-jobs.sh
#     restates each count and injects the width it was measured at (ahrefs/ocannl#1033), so
#     a change here goes there too. minix-amd-linux four, at `-j 4`: 16 hip-width at once was
#     green three ways (four `-j 4` batches, two `-j 8`, a full unit at `-j 16`) and 12 twice,
#     and only dune's default 32 has drained its device-wide SDMA pool. tuf-amd-linux three, at
#     `-j 8`: three `-j 8` hip batches were green on its discrete gfx1102. rog-nv-linux four, of
#     which two may hold its GPU (FLEET_BOX_GPU_TOKENS below): rungs of three or more concurrent
#     `-j 8` cuda batches hit CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY in 2 of 6 (10 of its 12 GiB in use),
#     while two cuda batches beside one or two cc batches were green, so the bound there is
#     GPU memory and not the box (ludics-lite#391).
#   FLEET_BOX_GPU_TOKENS: `<box>=<n>` pairs, how many of a box's correctness slots may run a
#     batch that holds its GPU at once (ludics-lite#391); an unnamed box has as many as it has
#     slots, so the pool binds nowhere else. "rog-nv-linux=2" whenever the roster is the default
#     one; set, even to empty, it overrides that. Fail-closed: every batch takes a token except
#     one that declares `execution slot --cpu`, so a GPU batch whose caller forgot to say so is
#     still counted. `preflight` prints the tokens beside the slots wherever they are fewer.
#   FLEET_SKILLS_REPO: skills checkout on each box; ~/ludics-lite.
#   ISSUE_WAVE_STATE: local worker-state directory; ~/.local/state/issue-wave.
#   FLEET_SLOT_STATE: where `execution slot` keeps a box's run-time slot locks;
#     ~/.local/state/fleet-execution-slots. Deliberately NOT under ISSUE_WAVE_STATE, which is
#     per-coordinator: the cap is the box's, so every agent on the box must resolve this to the
#     same directory (as every coordinator must resolve FLEET_ANCHOR_STATE to the same one).
#   FLEET_SLOT_HELD: set BY `execution slot` in its command's environment, never by hand:
#     `<box> <slot> <slots> <gpu|cpu>`, the slot the batch holds (THE NESTED SLOT, below).
#   FLEET_MEASUREMENT_HELD: set BY `execution hold --request <id>` in its command's environment,
#     never by hand: `<box> <id>`, the measurement the run belongs to (THE MEASUREMENT'S OWN RUN).
#   FLEET_SYSTEMD_INHIBIT: the systemd-inhibit that `execution hold` (and so `execution slot`)
#     wraps a run in; systemd-inhibit on PATH. A name that resolves to no executable runs the
#     command bare, as on macOS; the suites pin it to a stub or to nothing, never to the runner's.
#   FLEET_TMUX_SOCKET: tmux -L name; tests isolate with it.
#   FLEET_FLOTILLA: status service; http://mac-studio:7799.
#   FLEET_PRS_LIMIT: how many open PRs `prs` fetches; 1000. A list that reaches it says so.
#   FLEET_LOCK_WAIT: seconds a lease mutation waits for a concurrent one; 10.
#   FLEET_PROBE_TIMEOUT: wall-clock bound on the live headless preflight turn; 120.
#   FLEET_CROSS_TIMEOUT: wall-clock bound on each cross-box ssh reach probe of the preflight; 20.
#   FLEET_FETCH_TIMEOUT: wall-clock bound on skills-checkout and project fetches; 300.
#   FLEET_GH_TIMEOUT: wall-clock bound on each of the GitHub probe's API calls, `gh api user` and
#     the try of the credential git returns (git's helper gets twice that plus 5 s, the try
#     inside it included), in the preflight's session and in a tmux session; 30.
#   FLEET_REFRESH_TIMEOUT: wall-clock bound on `refresh`'s skills fetch (and so on the refresh
#     after a cross-box `execution run`/`dispatch`); 30.
#   FLEET_DELIVERY_WAIT: seconds an appending `unstick` waits for the CLI to echo the message; 20.
#     Past it the message is reported queued, not lost: a worker inside a long tool call reads it
#     when the call returns. `--interrupt` waits as long for the CLI's receipt of the interrupt.
#   FLEET_CLOSE_WAIT: seconds `close` waits for the CLI to exit after its input closes; 60.
#   FLEET_FEEDER_WAIT: seconds a claude worker's run.sh waits for its input feeder to record its
#     pid before refusing to start the CLI (exit 95); 10. Fixed into run.sh when `launch` or
#     `unstick` writes it, so it is the coordinator's value on every box.
