#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Exercises bg-run.sh with real background processes in a scratch directory -- no network, no
# harness. The command under test is always a small `sh -c` fixture, and every wait runs with a
# 1 s poll (BG_RUN_POLL=1) so the suite takes seconds rather than the production cadence.
#
# What it pins:
#   - a finished run reads rc=<its exit status> with exit 0, whatever that status is, and the
#     background `start` itself exits with it too -- on a directory `start` creates itself, the
#     path every caller that names its own directory still takes;
#   - `new` allocates: it creates the parent and prints <parent>/run-<N>, empty, one past the
#     highest run-<N> there (other names not counted); two `new`s racing for the same N each get
#     a directory of their own, and a copy without the exclusive mkdir is the control that
#     hands both the same one; a parent it cannot write in, or that is a file, is an error, not an
#     endless search; a wait on a `new` directory before `start` reads STARTING, and `start`
#     there runs and reads rc;
#   - race 1: a task killed before its command returned (so no rc is ever written) reads DIED,
#     promptly, rather than RUNNING until the window is spent -- with RUNNING as the control
#     while it was alive;
#   - race 2: output that quotes `rc=`, DIED or REFUSED cannot settle a wait, because the status is
#     a file the command's output does not reach: the wait reads RUNNING while that output sits
#     in the log, and then the real status;
#   - race 3: a wait that runs before the pid is published reads STARTING, never DIED -- on an
#     absent directory and on an empty one -- gives up on it after the start grace rather than
#     the whole window, and a wait already polling when `start` runs picks the run up;
#   - a wrapper killed alone while its command runs on reads RUNNING, not DIED, through cpid; and
#     a command that exited unreaped (a zombie, which still answers kill -0) reads DIED, and so
#     does a pid the system has reused for a process with another start time;
#   - a stale directory: `start` refuses one whose run has ended (finished or died), runs
#     nothing, leaves the earlier status untouched, and a wait on it reads REFUSED, not the
#     earlier run's rc; over a live run it is refused too, runs nothing, and marks nothing, so a
#     wait there still reports the live run;
#   - two starts racing on one fresh directory: exactly one runs its command, the other is refused
#     and leaves the winner's verdict alone -- also when the winner has already finished by the
#     time the loser's claim fails;
#   - a --within shorter than the poll interval is spent in full rather than answered at once;
#   - the finish-between-reads order: a dead pid beside an rc reads rc, not DIED;
#   - the usage errors (relative directory, missing `--`, a --within that is not a number), and
#     that a zero-padded number is read as decimal;
#   - when zsh is installed, a start issued through `zsh -c` the way the Bash tool issues it,
#     with its arguments passed through intact.
#
# Usage: test-bg-run.sh   (exit 0 all pass, 1 otherwise)
