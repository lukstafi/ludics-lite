"""The installed-routine drift guard (ludics-lite#199).

A local scheduled task runs from a COPY under ~/.claude/scheduled-tasks, and a copy drifts from this
checkout in silence. The guard lives inside the prompts -- each installed routine opens by running
scripts/sync-routines.sh and reading its own verdict -- and prose does not fail a test when somebody
edits it away. So this pins that it is there.

WHICH prompts are held is read off the script that installs them: its one-line ``LOCAL_ROUTINES``
assignment. WHAT is required is the COMMAND, not a mention: a Markdown indented-code line (four
blanks or more) whose whole content is THE path to this checkout's copy of the script, in status
mode, and nothing else -- so ``echo``/``cat`` arguments, an assignment, a commented-out line, a
backticked quotation, a ``push``/``pull`` argument and a same-basename path elsewhere all fail. The
checkout's ``~/<dir>`` half is read off the README's own clone command, never restated here, and
``$HOME`` is accepted for ``~``.
