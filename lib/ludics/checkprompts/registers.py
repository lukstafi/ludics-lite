"""Two lookups: the README index of the prompt directories, and the test-fixture register.

The index (``check_index``). Every directory carrying a SKILL.md is named in a row of its README
whose FIRST cell is the backticked name -- the whole claim, and a lookup rather than a parse. A
line is a row when, after an optional leading pipe, it opens with the backticked name and the next
non-blank character is a pipe (GFM renders a body row without its leading pipe, so both count).
The name is matched as TEXT, so a ``.`` is that character, a backslash is a backslash, and
``beta`` is not found in ``betas``. What it deliberately does NOT claim, after ludics-lite#75: that
the row renders. There is no table model -- no header, delimiter row, fence or comment scope -- so
a row-shaped line inside a code fence satisfies the lookup; and a row that outlives its directory
is not read, since that needs the same model.

The fixture register (``check_fixtures``). Every test file has a command line in the README's
``## Tests`` section and an inline run command on each CI platform it needs. A required platform
is a runner (``ubuntu``, ``macos``, ``windows``: the job's ``runs-on``, less ``-latest``) in
skill-scripts.yml, or ``git-bash``: a run line in the job keyed ``git-bash`` on a windows runner in
windows-git-bash.yml (ludics-lite#339), so a ship-pr suite run by another Windows job, whose steps
are PowerShell, is not its Git Bash leg (PR #321). The scan reads the workflow's literal shape --
``runs-on`` and ``run`` lines -- not YAML; comments, names, ``echo`` arguments and longer
filenames cannot stand in for a command.
