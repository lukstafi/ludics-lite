"""The mac-studio correctness-slot count: fleet-worker.sh's default, and every file that states it.

ludics-lite#160 raised ``FLEET_BOX_CORRECTNESS_SLOTS``' mac-studio default from three to six, and the
number is restated as prose all over the prompts. The default is one line of fleet-worker.sh; every
other statement of it is English, which does not fail a test when it goes stale -- so the number is
read off the script and every statement is required to say the same thing.

WHICH files are held is discovered, not listed: every ``*.md`` and ``*.sh`` under the root, minus the
mechanism's own two (``SLOT_MECHANISM``), is held exactly when it states the count. The three prompts
PR #166 quoted it in are also REQUIRED to keep stating it, so the agreement cannot go vacuous.

WHAT counts as a statement is two shapes: ``mac-studio=<n>`` (the whole token, so ``mac-studio=6oops``
is refused rather than accepted on its prefix; closing punctuation is punctuation), and the run of
numeral words standing before ``on mac-studio`` (``twenty-six``, ``twenty six``, ``one hundred and
six`` are each the whole count they state; ``done on mac-studio`` states none). The ``<N>, not <m>``
justification is deliberately not read (ludics-lite#202): nothing in that shape is about slots, and a
window wide enough to catch the real ones reads ordinary comparisons as counts. The word form is read
without further context, for the same reason; the cost, stated in #202, is that an unrelated
``version six on mac-studio`` would satisfy a required prompt's obligation.

Text INSIDE an assignment of the variable is skipped: a fixture configuring a two-slot box states its
own input. Which text that is is answered structurally -- the assignment word is walked from
``…SLOTS=`` to its first unquoted blank, over the file joined into one line -- and comments are
taken out first, so a commented-out assignment is prose and is held.

The default itself is the ``mac-studio=<n>`` inside the value of the LAST top-level ``SLOTS=``
assignment the shell keeps: not in a heredoc body (data the script writes), not in a function body
(defined, not run), not a command-prefix assignment (scoped to that command). A literal pair list is
validated whole, as the worker validates it: a malformed pair anywhere refuses the spec.

The shell-word readers below (``word_end``, ``uncommented``, ``code_of``, ``unquote``) keep the
shell checker's 1-based positions, since the spans they return are compared with positions in the
joined text.
