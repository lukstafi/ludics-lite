"""What every entry point shares: the streams, and how a command ends.

A command ends by RETURNING its exit status from its ``run``, or by raising ``Exit`` from any
depth -- the Python form of the shell's ``fail <rc> <message>``, which exits from inside whatever
function noticed. ``main_guard`` turns that into the message on stderr, prefixed with the script's
name the way the shell printed it, and the status.
