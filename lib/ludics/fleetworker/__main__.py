"""``scripts/py -m ludics.fleetworker <fleet-worker.sh path> <verb> <args...>``

What fleet-worker.sh runs for every verb, before the shell reads any configuration of its own: the
script's path as it was invoked (``"$0"``, from which the checkout and its sibling scripts are
found, and whose header is the usage text), then the verb and its arguments exactly as given. Every
knob is read from the environment, as the shell read it (``ludics.fleetworker.config``).

Every verb is served here (ludics-lite#403): the coordinator lease (claim, release, coordinator),
the halt (halt, resume-launches, halted), the native gate (gate), every ``execution`` action, the
preflight and refresh (``preflight``), a CLI worker's life (``workers``: launch, attach, status,
log, unstick, close, ls) and the supervision reads (``supervision``: load, prs). The one answer
fleet-worker.sh still gives itself is ``execution slot --probe``, which must answer on a box with no
Python >= 3.12 (THE PROBE WITHOUT PYTHON, in fleet-worker.sh).
