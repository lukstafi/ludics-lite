"""``execution``: the anchor's execution registry, and the conclusions read off a run on its box
(fleet-worker.sh's ``cmd_execution``, ``execution_listing``, ``execution_host_of``,
``conclude_from_run``, ``conclude_from_bg_run``, ``endpoint_map``, ``execution_refresh``).

The registry itself is ``ludics.fleetworker.registry``: its SOURCE travels to the anchor and runs
there from stdin under a Python >= 3.12 the far side finds (``FIND_PYTHON``), inside the lease
lock for every action but ``list``; its argv is ``root action coordinator token payload boxes
[slots map anchor lab]``. The rules it enforces are its own header's.

``execution slot`` and ``execution hold`` take no registry lock and run on THIS box: they are
``ludics.fleetworker.slot``.

The far sides of ``conclude --from-run`` and ``--from-bg-run`` stay the shell's, verbatim: they
run on the box that holds the run, and read its record with the tools that wrote it.
