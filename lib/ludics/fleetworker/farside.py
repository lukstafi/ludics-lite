"""fleet-worker.sh's FAR SIDE: the bash scripts every worker verb runs on the box, verbatim.

ludics-lite#403 moved fleet-worker.sh's near side -- argument parsing, the order of the reads, what
a status means to the coordinator -- to Python. What runs ON a box stays the bash it was: a far-side
script is composed here, read by ``bash -s`` on the box (a local child for this box, ``ssh <box>
bash -s`` for any other: ``transport.run_on``), its arguments as positional parameters. A box needs
bash, tmux, jq and git for a CLI worker, as it always did; no far side here needs Python (the
preflight only ASKS whether the box has one, below).

Every text is the shell's heredoc byte for byte, so a box runs exactly what it ran before the port,
and the comments inside them are the design notes they always were. What each one is, and the
composition the near side does around it:

  HELPERS      the prelude every far side starts with (``transport.prelude`` prefixes the paths,
               BOX and its locality): tmux, the worker record's readers, the mkdir lock, ``bounded``,
               the run.sh writer for a claude worker, the stale-tmux-server check
  FRESHNESS    the skills checkout's freshness, shared by the preflight and ``refresh``
  ghprobe(b)   the GitHub probe (``gh_bound`` = FLEET_GH_TIMEOUT, then GHPROBE), shared by the
               preflight and the far sides that create a worker session (launch, unstick)
  FLEET_PYTHON the first Python >= 3.12 in scripts/py's order, PY_CANDIDATES then PY_LAUNCHER_ARGS
               (the registry's interpreter, and the preflight's probe of the box)
  PREFLIGHT    after FRESHNESS, ghprobe and FLEET_PYTHON
  REFRESH      after FRESHNESS
  LAUNCH_EXISTS, LAUNCH_FETCH, LAUNCH (after ghprobe)
  VERDICT      the verdict of a finished worker, for ATTACH and CLOSE
  ATTACH, STATUS, LOG, UNSTICK (after ghprobe), CLOSE, LS

# git.out, then done. The git half asks for github.com's HTTPS credential as a push does, with
# prompts and askpass off, and once the API call passed, tries the credential git returned against
# GitHub: a helper can hold a stale password beside a live GH_TOKEN, and retrieving one proves
# nothing about it. The credential lives in a variable and in that one call's GH_TOKEN, never in
# a file: git.out holds git's stderr and gh's error alone. The account must be the one gh's own
# token answered as, since that is who opens the PR (the fleet pushes as one user). Its exits: 0
# accepted (or retrieved, when there was nothing to try it against), 1 no credential, 2 GitHub
# refused it, 3 no password, 4 another account's, 5 GitHub did not answer the try; 124 is then the
# helper's own silence, since the try is bounded inside.
# With `tmux` it ends by killing its own session, so `remain-on-exit` or an interrupted preflight

# box's `gh` (git's credential helper here too), and on 2026-09-23 a dead keyring token surfaced
# an hour into a worker's task, and another worker routed around it with a copied token. Since
# 2026-09-24 every box instead exports one PAT as GH_TOKEN from ~/.config/fleet/gh-token.sh, which
# env.sh sources (per-box keyring logins revoked each other: GitHub keeps 10 OAuth tokens per
# user and app). So the
# preflight makes the call a worker makes, `gh api user`, from the same kind of session: this
# script runs as a non-interactive `ssh <box> bash -s` (or a local child on the anchor), which is
# NOT the box's desktop console. On 2026-09-24 minix's `gh auth status` was reported green at the
# desktop while its token answered HTTP 401 over non-interactive ssh, and rog's gh 2.46 exited 0
# from `auth status` over "The token in keyring is invalid", so neither a console nor a status
# read is the proof. Classification is a fail-closed allowlist: a login on stdout with exit 0 passes; a
# call with no answer in time, gh's "error connecting to" (DNS, TCP, TLS) or an HTTP 5xx means
# GitHub did not answer, which is noted on the OK line like a sleeping sibling (git fetch above
# already refuses a box that cannot reach GitHub at all); everything else - a 401, gh's "gh auth
# login" hint, any output this list does not name - refuses with the user-side repair.
# The push path and the tmux server too (ludics-lite#374; ghprobe_fn above): git's credential for
# github.com is asked for as a push asks and tried against GitHub, and for a CLI worker the probe
# runs again as a session of the tmux server the worker would start in (the running one, or one
# started from this shell) - only once it passed here, so a failure there is tmux's to repair.
# Boundary: it proves what `gh api --hostname github.com user` answers, and that git gets a
# credential for https://github.com (outside any repository) that GitHub accepts, in this session,
# the session a native worker, a leg and a NEW tmux server get, and in a new session of the running
# tmux server a CLI worker would start in. It does not read what a worker's own tool shell re-sources on top of that, a
# repository's own credential config, a remote over ssh (a box pushing only over ssh is refused
# for a missing helper it does not need), or a token /user does not accept (an app installation
# token; the fleet pushes as the user).
