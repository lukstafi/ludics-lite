"""The coordinator lease and the stop-the-world halt: ``claim``, ``release``, ``coordinator``, ``halt``,
``resume-launches``, ``halted``, and the anchor gate the native ``gate`` reads (fleet-worker.sh's
``cmd_claim``, ``cmd_release``, ``cmd_coordinator``, ``cmd_halt``, ``cmd_resume_launches``,
``cmd_halted``, ``anchor_gate``).

Fleet-wide state lives on one anchor box (FLEET_ANCHOR), never on whichever box the coordinator
runs on: the lease is one file there, ``$ANCHOR_STATE/COORDINATOR`` (host, token, since), and the
halt is ``$ANCHOR_STATE/HALT``. Every lease mutation runs under the lease lock
``COORDINATOR.lock`` on the anchor, taken by the prelude's ``take_lock`` (the one mkdir lock every
far side uses), so the far-side scripts below are the shell's, verbatim; this module is their near
side, and ``anchor_gate`` is what launch, unstick and close read first. An anchor that does not
answer is ``<VERB> UNREACHABLE <anchor>``, exit 4, never a verdict about the lease.
