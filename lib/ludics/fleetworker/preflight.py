"""``preflight`` and ``refresh``: is a box fit to run a worker, and bring its skills checkout current
(fleet-worker.sh's ``cmd_preflight``, ``preflight_script``, ``siblings_of``, ``slots_report``,
``cmd_refresh``, ``refresh_box``).

Both run on the box that will run the work, because that box's ~/.claude/skills symlinks serve
whatever its checkout holds (ludics-lite#3). The checks themselves are the far side's
(``farside.PREFLIGHT``, ``farside.REFRESH``, sharing ``farside.FRESHNESS`` so the two can never
disagree about what "current" means); this module composes them, reads the knobs that bound them,
and reports the correctness slots this configuration gives each roster box.

The bounds, each a wall-clock limit read as the shell read it (``${X:-default}``):
FLEET_PROBE_TIMEOUT (the live headless turn, 120), FLEET_FETCH_TIMEOUT (the skills fetch, 300),
FLEET_CROSS_TIMEOUT (each cross-box reach probe, 20), FLEET_GH_TIMEOUT (each GitHub call, 30) and
FLEET_REFRESH_TIMEOUT (``refresh``'s fetch, 30: it runs after every cross-box ``execution run``,
where a coordinator is waiting on it).
