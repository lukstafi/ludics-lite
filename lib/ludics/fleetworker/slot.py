"""``execution slot`` and ``execution hold``: the run-time correctness slots of THIS box, and its
OS-level sleep guard (fleet-worker.sh's ``cmd_execution_slot``, ``cmd_execution_hold`` and the
Python program they ran, ``run_py``, whose four modes -- slot, nested, measured, bare, hold -- are
the functions below, in one process).

The design notes, moved verbatim from fleet-worker.sh, are the comment blocks below this
docstring (THE SLOTS, THE GPU TOKENS, THE NESTED SLOT, THE GUARD; then ``execution hold``'s THE
MEASUREMENT'S OWN RUN and THE DRAIN); issue-wave/references/executions.md is the user's side. In
brief:

- THE SLOTS (ludics-lite#160): one flock file per slot under the box's own state directory, held on
  an open descriptor that survives the exec of the wrapped command, so the kernel releases it
  however the batch dies. There is no ``--box``: a slot on another machine is a lock on the wrong
  disk.
- THE GPU TOKENS (ludics-lite#391): where a box has T tokens, fewer than its slots, the first T
  slot files are the tokens. Fail-closed: a batch is a GPU batch unless it declares ``--cpu``, and
  a ``--cpu`` batch takes the highest free slot, reaching the tokens last.
- THE NESTED SLOT (ahrefs/ocannl#1004) and THE MEASUREMENT'S OWN RUN (ludics-lite#480): an
  enclosing slot's ``FLEET_SLOT_HELD`` marker, or an enclosing ``hold --request``'s
  ``FLEET_MEASUREMENT_HELD``, is JUDGED, never trusted -- it must name this box and a lock held
  NOW -- and a batch it covers runs under the enclosing hold, taking nothing. The two judgements
  are one shape, ``Judged``: Inside, Take (the marker does not cover the batch: say why, take a slot
  of its own), or Refused.
- THE DRAIN (ludics-lite#481): a ``hold --request`` takes every slot of the box before its command
  starts, so no batch runs beside a measurement.
- THE GUARD (ludics-lite#317): a logind ``block`` inhibitor on sleep:idle, held by a HELPER beside
  the command (systemd-inhibit closes the descriptors of the process it runs, SIGTERMs it, and
  rewrites its exit status, so it must never wrap the batch), alive for as long as anything in the
  command's tree holds the lifetime pipe. Fail-open, and loudly.

A wrapper must not change a batch's verdict: the command is exec'd on this pid, with the signal
dispositions Python changed (SIGPIPE, SIGXFSZ ignored) put back first.

# ===============================================================================================
# From fleet-worker.sh, above the shell's `run_py`:
#
# `execution slot [--wait <seconds>] -- <command...>`: the RUN-TIME half of the correctness cap
# (ludics-lite#160). The registry reservation is ownership and evidence, held for a worker's whole
# life including its review waits, so counting it against the box's slots capped agents in flight
# rather than concurrent load -- on 2026-09-16 a fourth worker was refused a standing reservation
# while the three holding the slots were reading their briefs and nothing was running at all. So a
# standing record consumes no slot (`"standing": true` in the reservation), and the slots are taken
# HERE instead, by the worker itself, around one suite or batch.
#
# The lock is a real flock, N holders: one file per slot under the box's own state directory, and
# the holder is the open descriptor, inherited across the exec of the wrapped command. That is why
# there is no stale-lock reclaim to get wrong -- the kernel drops the lock when the process dies,
# however it dies, including a kill -9 of a whole batch. The repository's own mkdir `take_lock`
# could not serve: it is defined in the far-side prelude, for scripts shipped to a box, and this
# lock has to outlive the acquiring process's exec on THIS box. There is no --box for the same
# reason: a slot on another machine would be a lock on the wrong disk.
#
# THE GPU TOKENS (ludics-lite#391). On rog-nv-linux the bound is the GPU's 12 GiB, not the box:
# three concurrent cuda batches ran out of device memory, while two ran clean beside two cc
# batches. So where FLEET_BOX_GPU_TOKENS gives a box T tokens, fewer than its slots, the first T
# slot files are its GPU tokens: a GPU batch may take only slot.1..slot.T, and a batch declared
# `--cpu` takes the highest free slot, reaching the GPU ones last. Two properties follow, and both
# are why this is not a second lock pool beside the slots:
#   - fail-closed: a batch is a GPU batch unless it declares `--cpu` (`--gpu` says the default),
#     so one whose caller forgot to declare it is still held to T, and a CPU batch that forgot
#     only waits longer;
#   - safe across the switch: the script before #391 gave rog-nv-linux two slots and took the
#     first free one, so a batch it started holds slot.1 or slot.2 -- which this version counts as
#     a token. A separate token pool would have seen two free tokens beside two such batches and
#     let four cuda batches onto the GPU while the box's checkout moved from one version to the
#     other.
# The cost is fragmentation: a CPU batch that fell back into a GPU slot keeps it until it ends,
# even after a higher slot frees. A GPU batch waiting on a token holds no slot meanwhile. Where a
# box has as many tokens as slots nothing binds, and every batch takes the first free slot as
# before, so every box but the one the token spec narrows is unchanged.
#
# THE NESTED SLOT (ahrefs/ocannl#1004). A project runner may take the slot itself (OCANNL's
# tools/test-run.sh does, declaring --cpu from the backend it resolves), so no brief has to name
# the wrapper and no worker can forget it -- but a worker that still wraps the runner would then
# hold two slots for one batch, and four such workers on a four-slot box would each hold one and
# wait for another until the deadline refused them all. So a held slot exports FLEET_SLOT_HELD
# (`<box> <slot> <slots> <gpu|cpu>`, the last saying whether that slot may hold the GPU) to the
# command, and an `execution slot` that finds it runs its command under the enclosing slot rather
# than taking a second one: no flock, no registry read (the enclosing take made it), no second
# sleep guard. The marker is judged, never trusted: it must name this box and a slot this spec
# has, and that slot must be held NOW (a non-blocking flock on it must fail), so a marker exported
# by hand, or outliving its batch, is said so and ignored and a slot is taken as usual. Whether
# the slot may hold the GPU is judged from the current token spec, not from the marker's own word,
# and a GPU batch inside a slot an enclosing batch took as --cpu is refused: the enclosing
# declaration was wrong, and running would put a GPU batch past the tokens.
#
# The measurement check is a point-in-time gate read from the anchor's registry, exactly as
# `execution dispatch` is: it refuses to start a batch beside an outstanding measurement, and
# a measurement reserved afterwards is the registry's exclusivity to enforce, not this lock's.
# The one batch it admits there is the measurement's own, run inside that measurement's
# `execution hold --request` (THE MEASUREMENT'S OWN RUN, at `execution hold`).
#
# EVERY correctness run on the box goes through this lock, an assigned one (a full suite, a
# cross-box leg) exactly as much as a standing worker's batch: it is the single run-time
# mechanism, and the registry's reservation cap stays a bound on how many non-standing
# assignments may be QUEUED there. Subtracting outstanding assignments from the cap here would
# re-introduce the very thing #160 removes - a run refused because of a record that is not
# running, its own included.
#
# Inside the slot the command runs under the OS-level sleep guard `execution hold` takes
# (ludics-lite#317, below), so a correctness batch on a native Linux box carries the guard a
# measurement does, for exactly as long as the batch runs. One Python program serves both
# subcommands; `slot` is `hold` plus the flock.
# Exit: the wrapped command's own status; 1 with a line beginning `EXECUTION SLOT REFUSED` (no
# free slot or GPU token before the deadline, an outstanding measurement, a malformed spec); 4 when the
# anchor's registry could not be read; 127 when the command itself could not be run. The command
# is exec'd and not interpreted, so a pipeline or a builtin goes as `sh -c '...'`.
#
# THE GUARD (ludics-lite#317). Under WSL the Windows-side holder kept a lane's box alive; on
# native Ubuntu nothing at the OS level stopped another session's `wake-lab.sh sleep`, or an idle
# suspend, from taking a box out from under a running worker, because the lab locks are advisory
# and bind only sessions that go through wake-lab.sh. A logind BLOCK inhibitor on sleep:idle is
# the OS-side answer: systemd 259's `systemctl --check-inhibitors=yes suspend` (wake-lab.sh's
# path) refuses on any `block` inhibitor covering sleep, the caller's own uid included -- only
# `block-weak` exempts the same user, which is why the mode here is `block` -- and logind itself
# refuses a suspend request from anyone without `suspend-ignore-inhibit`, a GDM greeter's
# included.
#
# The inhibitor is held by a HELPER beside the command, never by a wrapper around it, and that
# shape is forced by what systemd-inhibit does to the process it runs (measured on rog-nv-linux,
# systemd 259): it closes every descriptor above 2 in its child, so a batch run UNDER it would
# no longer inherit the slot's flock; it SIGTERMs that child when it dies itself; and it turns a
# command killed by a signal into exit 1 and adds a "<cmd> failed with exit status <n>." line --
# a wrapper that changes verdicts, and a PID that is not the workload's, so killing `$!` would
# kill systemd-inhibit and not the batch (PR #323 review, round 1). So the helper is
# `systemd-inhibit ... -- sh -c 'echo HELD; exec cat'`, reading a LIFETIME PIPE whose write end
# the command inherits, and the command is exec'd exactly as before, on this PID, with the flock:
# the inhibitor then lives as long as anything in the command's process tree holds that pipe --
# the same lifetime as the flock, ended by the kernel however the tree ends, including a kill -9
# of the command alone. The helper is double-forked so it is never the command's child: a
# workload that waits for all of its children would otherwise wait on it forever. It reports
# through a readiness pipe -- HELD once the inhibitor is taken, or systemd-inhibit's own refusal
# and EOF -- and the command starts only after that answer, so there is no window in which the
# run has started and the box is not yet held.
#
# Fail-open, and loudly. An unprivileged ssh session is a REMOTE subject to polkit, so
# `org.freedesktop.login1.inhibit-block-sleep` falls under its `allow_any`, which stock Ubuntu
# sets to auth_admin_keep: until the box's one-time polkit grant is installed (executions.md,
# "The OS-level sleep guard") the request is denied. A run refused for that would stop every
# batch on the box over a setup step, so a denial prints a WARNING naming it and runs the command
# bare -- exactly as it runs on macOS, or on a Linux host with no systemd-inhibit at all.
# No `--no-ask-password`: systemd-inhibit gained it in v257, so 255 (Ubuntu 24.04) and 256 reject
# it as an unknown option, which would turn every hold there into the unguarded path (PR #323
# review, round 1). It is not needed either: the helper's stdio are pipes, so systemd-inhibit has
# no terminal to start a polkit agent on, and a denial comes back at once.
#
# ===============================================================================================
# From fleet-worker.sh, above the shell's `cmd_execution_hold`:
#
# `execution hold [--why <text>] [--request <id>] -- <command...>`: run the command under THIS
# box's OS-level guard against sleep and nothing else -- no slot, no registry read, no lease
# (ludics-lite#317; the guard itself is described under THE GUARD above). It is the wrapper for an
# exclusive measurement, which runs the runner without a slot of its own because `execution slot`
# refuses every batch beside an outstanding measurement, and `slot` takes the same guard inside
# the flock, so both kinds of run carry it through one implementation. Where no systemd-inhibit
# resolves it runs the command bare and says nothing. Needs python3, as `slot` does (the per-box
# preflight checks it).
#
# THE MEASUREMENT'S OWN RUN (ludics-lite#480). A runner that takes the slot itself (OCANNL's
# tools/test-run.sh) asked for one inside its own measurement's hold and was refused by that very
# measurement (exit 75, SLOT REFUSED), five times in one wave, and the workaround was folklore
# every brief had to carry (`OCANNL_TOOL_FLEET_WORKER=none`). So `--request <id>` names the
# measurement this hold runs: the command gets FLEET_MEASUREMENT_HELD=`<box> <id>` and inherits a
# SHARED flock on `<slot dir>/measurement.lock`, and an `execution slot` that finds the marker
# runs its command under this hold, with no slot taken, instead of refusing it -- as the nested
# slot runs under an enclosing one. The marker is judged, never trusted, and what confirms it is
# exactly this, nothing else: it names this box, the registry's outstanding measurements on this
# box are that one request id and no other (so an unknown, concluded or correctness request, or
# another box's, is not confirmed), and the lock is held NOW by some `hold --request` on this box.
# That last check is per box, not per request: the registry admits one measurement on a box at a
# time, so a live hold there is that measurement's. An unconfirmed marker is said so and ignored,
# and the batch is refused while any measurement is outstanding -- as is a batch with no marker,
# an independent correctness batch on the measured box among them. The hold itself reads no
# registry, so it never refuses a measurement over the anchor; a mistyped id is caught by the
# first `slot` inside it, which is refused.
#
# THE DRAIN (ludics-lite#481): with --request the hold also takes every slot of the box before the
# command starts, waiting for a batch that holds one, and the command's tree inherits them, so no
# batch runs beside a measurement: not one running when it was reserved (a measurement window
# reserves one on a box whose workers are iterating), nor one that was waiting for a slot then.
# The slot check reads the registry once, at the batch's start, and cannot see either. A nested
# hold of the same live measurement takes none, since its enclosing hold holds them.
# Exit: the command's own status; 127 with `EXECUTION HOLD REFUSED` when it cannot be run; 2 usage.
