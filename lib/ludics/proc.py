"""Starting external programs: the one place in the package that does.

Every external tool -- ``gh``, ``git`` -- is run as a BINARY resolved on PATH, never replaced by an
HTTP client or a library, so the fixtures that drive the shell scripts drive the Python too: a
fake ``gh`` first on PATH answers both.

The shell bridge. The pr-review suites do not put a fake ``gh`` on PATH: they SOURCE the script
and define ``gh`` as a shell FUNCTION, whose answers read the suite's own variables. A Python
process cannot call a function of the shell that started it, so the shell's forwarder (``py_forward``
in pr-review.sh) hands it the next best thing when, and only when, one of the commands it would
run is a shell function there:

  LUDICS_BRIDGE_FUNCS  the names that are functions in the forwarding shell (``gh git``);
  LUDICS_BRIDGE_STATE  a file holding that shell's functions and variables (``declare -f``,
                       ``declare -p``) and its ``-u``/``pipefail`` options;
  LUDICS_BRIDGE_SHELL  that shell's own bash (``$BASH``), so the file is read by the bash that
                       wrote it -- bash 3.2's output in bash 3.2.

A bridged call runs ``<bash> -c '. <state>; <name> "$@"'``: a fresh shell holding the same
definitions and values the forwarder's shell had, which is what the shell implementation's
``$(gh ...)`` saw -- it, too, ran every gh call in a subshell, so a fixture already keeps
anything that must outlive one call in a FILE. With none of the three set, which is every
production run, a tool is the binary on PATH and nothing else.
