"""``pr-review.sh base [owner/name] [branch] [--wait[=s]] [--interim] [--integration-records f]``

Is the base branch's CI green? Ported from the shell's ``cmd_base`` and the helpers only it uses
(ludics-lite#403): ``base_red_detail``, ``base_page_judged``, ``base_push_trigger``, the
paths-ignore settle (``range_files``, ``commit_files``, ``commits_ignored``,
``tip_within_paths_ignore``), and the two named sources of a tip no push run judges
(``tip_pr_head_verdict``, ``tip_named_source``). The shell's comments carry the incident history
of every rule here; this file keeps the load-bearing ones, and the shell region they came from
(``cmd_base`` and the helpers above it, in ship-pr/scripts/pr-review.sh at c856bb0, the v2 branch
point) is where to read the rest. The helpers ``base`` shares with ``checks``/``merge`` -- the
workflow-file readers, ``range_files`` and ``commit_files`` (workflows.Reads), the advisory list
(ere.Advisory) and the gate itself (gate.Gate) -- are ported once, there.

WHY ``base`` EXISTS, and why ``--wait``. The other half of ahrefs/ocannl#694: the confusion lands
on whoever branches off a broken master, so the base's own CI is read before work starts, not
only before merging. ``--wait`` is for the other end of a branch's life, the roll-forward
policy's complement: "after a merge, read the base's CI on what you just landed" -- and a plain
``base`` seconds after a merge answers with the PREVIOUS tip's green, because the merge's own run
is queued or not created yet. So ``--wait`` re-reads until nothing non-advisory is mid-flight and
every non-advisory workflow's newest judged run is about the CURRENT tip -- or, with nothing in
flight and NO run for the tip at all, until the workflow's own paths-ignore says none can be
created for this tip (a docs-only push never gets one), or failing that until a grace expires
(SHIP_PR_BASE_ABSENT_GRACE, all that separates "never coming" from "not yet"). Then it settles
for the verdicts in hand, saying which commit each is about. Two absences it will not settle: a
run that EXISTS for the tip and has not judged it (only that run can answer), and a run in flight
anywhere on the branch (it judges a tree the tip contains). A red at the tip breaks the wait at
once: it is a verdict.

Stdout: the verdict line, then one line per workflow (and its notes). Exit: 0 green (an interim
green under --interim included); 1 red; 2 usage or configuration; 3 UNKNOWN (a read the verdict
rests on failed); 4 no verdict (nothing ran, nothing judged the tip, or --wait ran out).

The merged PR head's build signal (source (a)) is ``gate_checks``, the ``checks`` subcommand's
gate (gate.Gate), run as ``tip_pr_head_verdict`` ran it: no wait, under this command's advisory
list, its report captured and its stderr dropped.

# --- the named sources ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A default branch without push CI (ludics-lite#401). A workflow that used to run on pushes to this
# branch and whose file at the tip no longer declares `push` leaves its push runs standing
# forever: `event=push` pages never age out, so the fold would keep presenting the last push run's
# verdict -- days or months old -- as the base's. A stale green is worse than none. So such a
# workflow's push rows are not read as a verdict at all, and the tip's verdict for it comes only
# from a source this file can NAME, in this order:
#
#   (b) an INTEGRATION RECORD: a wave coordinator's own run concluded at exactly the tip, handed in
#       by `fleet-worker.sh gate` as `--integration-records <file>`. About the tip's own tree, so
#       it goes first, and a failed one is RED.
#   (a) the MERGED PR'S HEAD RUN under the roll-forward rule: the tip is GitHub's own merge commit
#       of one merged pull request into this branch, its second parent is that PR's head, and the
#       head's build signal -- the one `merge` gated on -- is green (or red).
#
# Anything else is "no verdict", never an older green. Source (c), the latest daily sweep record
# at or after the tip, has no machine-readable form on this side and is not read (#414).
#
# "Clean merge" is established from the commit, not assumed: exactly two parents, committed by
# GitHub itself (`noreply@github.com`) with a signature GitHub verified. GitHub makes a merge
# commit only for a PR it can merge without conflict, so its own merge carries nothing the head did
# not; a merge made elsewhere can carry a resolution the head's run never saw, and a squash or a
# rebase keeps no head in the history at all. The workflows the verdict is FOR must each have a run
# of their own at the head that concluded `success` with a non-advisory job that succeeded: the
# head's build signal is an aggregate, and on a docs-only PR the retired `ci` is filtered out by
# its `pull_request` paths-ignore while another workflow passes (review rounds 1 and 2).
