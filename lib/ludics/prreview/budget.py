"""The polling budget (ludics-lite#543): the pause, the quota hold and the one observer per PR.

Ported from pr-review.sh's "the polling budget" section (``budget_*``, ``quota_failure``,
``hold_read``/``hold_set``/``hold_lift``, ``lock_take``/``lock_reap``, ``observer_*``; main at
c3de596). On 2026-10-04 a parallel OCANNL wave exhausted the account's REST quota while approved
heads waited for hosted macOS runners. Every ``merge --wait`` re-read each minute, a quota 403
ended it with exit 3, and its caller armed another, so the reads went on. The recovery used three
policies, and this module turns them into the one mechanism every observer here shares (``watch``,
``checks --wait``, ``merge --wait``, ``retry run watch``). issue-wave reaches GitHub only through
pr-review.sh, so its waves use it too:

1. THE PAUSE. An observer's first read is immediate, and so is the first read after one that saw a
   change. Each read that saw nothing new doubles the pause, from the command's own interval
   (WATCH_INTERVAL, SHIP_PR_CHECKS_INTERVAL) up to its kind's cap: SHIP_PR_REVIEW_POLL_CAP (300)
   for a review, SHIP_PR_BUILD_POLL_CAP (600) for a build. Those are the 10-04 recovery's
   intervals, reached only by a queue that is not moving. A cap at or below the interval keeps the
   interval fixed.
2. THE HOLD. A call GitHub refuses on QUOTA sets one hold for every pr-review.sh process that
   shares this state directory (the user's, on this host), and no call is made while it stands.
   When it ends is read from the FAILING ENDPOINT's own response headers, by one ``gh api -i``
   probe of that endpoint: Retry-After, or else X-RateLimit-Reset when X-RateLimit-Remaining is 0.
   It is never read from /rate_limit, which disagreed with the failing endpoint during the
   incident. A response with neither header holds for a minute, doubling on each repeat, and so
   does a probe that answers: it is a GET or GraphQL's viewer query, and a secondary limit on the
   refused operation itself need not show on it. A standing hold is only ever extended, never
   shortened, by a later refusal (each refusal adds its own entry; see ``hold_read``). Once the
   hold has ended, ONE process probes the same endpoint again, and the hold lifts only when that
   endpoint answers. A quota answer sets the next hold from its own headers. An observer (a
   command with a wait ceiling) waits a hold out within its ceiling, then repeats the READ the
   quota stopped. A write never waits, since it would act on reads the hold made stale, and every
   other command returns 3 at once, without a call.
3. THE OBSERVER. One observer per PR and kind (review: ``watch``; build: ``checks --wait`` and
   ``merge --wait``). A second is refused with exit 2, naming the first's pid, rather than
   doubling the reads. A holder that is no longer running is replaced.

A quota failure is never the API's answer about the PR. ``GhSession.retry`` returns
``GhUnanswered`` (exit 3) for it, read or write, so it reads as UNKNOWN everywhere and can never
permit a merge.

BOUNDARY. The quota reader is a fail-closed ALLOWLIST over the FIRST line of gh's stderr, with
these shapes: ``API rate limit exceeded`` or ``API rate limit already exceeded`` (the primary limit,
in its REST and GraphQL spellings), ``secondary rate limit``, and ``(HTTP 429)``. A 403 with any
other message is still the API's answer. The probe reads its own answer: the headers up to the
first blank line, and the body after it in ``quota_failure``'s words (GraphQL answers an exhausted
quota with a 200). A probe addresses the call's own endpoint: the one positional of ``api``,
``repos/<repo>/actions/runs/<id>`` (or ``.../jobs/<id>`` with ``--job``) for ``run view``, and
``graphql`` for every other gh command, since gh's pr and issue commands ride GraphQL, which has its
own quota. A call whose endpoint cannot be told sets no hold. The budget covers this script's OWN
calls to github.com: a ``retry`` caller's call (any host, repository or command form gh accepts) is
neither gated nor held, a GH_HOST naming another server takes every call out, and every probe
names github.com. A gate round that waited a hold out between its reads is read again whole
(``Gate.check``), and nothing after ``merge``'s gate waits a hold out at all; ``watch`` rounds are
not re-read (an approval it reports still goes through that gate). The hold is per state
directory, not per account: another host learns of the quota from its own first refusal. And one
state directory serves ONE credential: the hold is that token's quota, so a second token on the
same host (a GH_TOKEN of its own) sets a SHIP_PR_STATE_DIR of its own. Every gh call passes the
hold's gate: the session's, and ``repo_from_cwd``'s ``gh repo view``. An observer counts as live
while its pid runs, so a pid the OS has reused reads as live until that process ends. The refusal
names the pid. Two processes replacing one dead lock at the same moment are kept apart by
``lock_reap``; a third arriving in that same window can still make two observers, which costs
duplicate reads and never a verdict.

THE STATE DIRECTORY is shared by every pr-review.sh on the host, whatever its version (the shell's
budget on main, this port), so its format is the shell's, byte for byte:

  quota-holds/<until>.<unique>   one hold entry: "<endpoint> TAB <length> TAB <why>" and a newline,
                                 written aside (``.new.<unique>``) and renamed in
  quota-last                     "<epoch> TAB <length>": the last lifted hold, for the doubling
  quota-probe/owner              the probe lock: "<pid>" and "<epoch taken>", one per line
  observers/<owner~repo#n.kind>/owner
                                 an observer lock, the same two lines (the key lowercased)
