"""The closing-keyword scans ``merge`` runs before every attempt: the PR body, and the commit series.

Ported from pr-review.sh's ``MULTI_CLOSE_FILTER`` (an awk program in the shell),
``warn_multi_close`` (ludics-lite#227) and ``warn_series_close`` (#296). The filter's rules are the
product of seventeen review rounds, each recorded in the shell's comment beside the rule it
shaped; this is the same filter, rule for rule, in the same order:

  * a body line is classified (indentation in tab-expanded columns, list markers peeled, fences
    opened and closed only on their own delimiter, ``>`` quotes), then cut into sentence units at
    terminal punctuation followed by whitespace;
  * in each unit, URLs are scrubbed first, then ONE match finds a closing keyword between
    whitelisted boundaries, and the references are read FORWARD from it, each needing a
    whitelisted boundary before it and no identifier character after it, deduplicated
    case-insensitively with this repository's own qualified spelling folded into the bare one;
  * a unit is reported when its keyword binds two or more references (``sentence``), or any
    reference inside a quoted, fenced or (in a commit message) indented line (``quoted``).

awk's regex matching is leftmost-longest and Python's is leftmost-first; every pattern below was
checked to choose the same match under both (each is either fixed-width at its end or has a
greedy tail no alternative can outrun). Lowercasing is ASCII-only, as the shell's awk did it, so
offsets into the unit stay the unit's own. Checked against the shell's awk program on 8,176 bodies
and messages (the merge suite's, and generated ones) in the C locale: identical findings. One
divergence, on purpose: macOS awk 20200816 in a UTF-8 locale ABORTS ("towc: multibyte conversion
failure") on a reference followed by a non-ASCII letter, which the shell reported as a scan that
did not run; here such a body is scanned. A sentence is cut at 200 characters, not bytes.
