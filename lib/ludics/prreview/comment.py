"""``pr-review.sh comment <pr> <body> [--allow-mention]``: a plain PR comment, over REST.

Ported from the shell's ``cmd_comment`` (ludics-lite#403).

Not every finding has a thread to answer in: a review's SUMMARY body carries no comment ids, so its
answer is a plain PR comment -- and so is the '@codex review' nudge the watch verdicts recommend.
``gh pr comment`` does not take the owner/name#number form this script standardizes on (during
lukstafi/ocannl-staging#475's release prep the workaround was hand-building the PR's URL), so the
comment is POSTed to the REST issues endpoint, through the same write policy as every other write.
issues/<n>/comments and not pulls/<n>/comments: on GitHub a PR *is* an issue, and the pulls endpoint
posts INLINE review comments, which need a commit and a path. Same marker as ``reply``.

A body mentioning '@codex' is refused before any request unless ``--allow-mention``; the bare nudge
is the one body that passes without it (``reply.mention_refusal``).

Stdout: the comment's html_url. Exit: 0 posted; 1 the API rejected it (a 4xx); 2 usage; 3 a gateway
refusal on every attempt (nothing was posted), or an ambiguous failure (it may have been: a POST
adds a comment, so this script will not send it twice).
