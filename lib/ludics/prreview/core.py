"""The shared core of pr-review.sh, ported from its prelude (everything above ``cmd_poll``).

What is here, and the shell function each piece ports (the shell's comments carry the incident
history; read them there before changing a rule here):

  fail / die / warn               ``fail``, ``die``, ``warn``: exit codes 1 = the fact does not
                                  hold, 2 = the caller or the environment is wrong, 3 = the API
                                  never answered, so nothing is known (4 and 5 belong to the
                                  commands that define them)
  Config / load_config            the source-time constants and their validation
  GhSession.retry / retry_caller  ``gh_retry`` and its classification: ``gateway_failure``,
                                  ``api_rejection``, ``graphql_fixed_answer``,
                                  ``gh_client_refusal``, ``transient_failure``, ``gh_err_line``,
                                  ``gh_refused_own`` (an exception here, not a USR2 trap and a
                                  marker file: #471's stop is one ``GhRefusedOwn`` reaching main)
  gh_api_only_command             ``gh_api_only_command`` (the allowlist for a CALLER's args)
  parse_ref / pr_arg / resolve_repo / repo_from_cwd
                                  the repository rules (ludics-lite#92: never from the cwd for a
                                  PR; ``repo_from_cwd`` survives for ``base`` alone)
  api_list / mark_of              ``api_list`` (a feed that is whole or absent) and ``mark_of``

Not here: the jq line-ending probe (``jq_eol_probe``: Python reads JSON itself, so no jq), the
per-attempt stderr temp files and their sweep (captured in memory here), and the round snapshot
(``snapshot_*``: it existed because a command substitution's variables die with its subshell;
a Python watch keeps its round in an object -- the watch porter's to design).

Every gh call goes through ``proc.run_tool``: the gh BINARY on PATH, or the suites' fixture
function through the shell bridge (see ``ludics.proc``).
