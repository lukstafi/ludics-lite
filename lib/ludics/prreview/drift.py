"""How far a PR's branch has drifted from its base: the read ``merge`` prints right before its call.

Ported from pr-review.sh's ``warn_base_drift`` with ``compare_hunks`` and ``compare_file_set``
(ludics-lite#44, #54, #63, #84, and the ahrefs/ocannl#861 roll-forward decision that made it a
WARNING). The base's tip is read from the branch, never from the PR's ``base.sha`` snapshot; both
compares are anchored on that one tip; an overlapping path is split by whether the two sides' hunks
meet, and a patch that cannot be read hunk by hunk is UNREAD, never disjoint. A read that could not
be completed prints UNKNOWN and is never "not behind" or "none".

``watch`` reads the same thing at the end of a round (``watch_drift_note``), all of it on stderr
there; this module is the one port of the function both call.
