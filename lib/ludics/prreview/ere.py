"""The advisory EREs, read by ``grep -E`` itself, as the shell read them.

The list is configuration whose contract is grep's: "one ERE per line, in SHIP_PR_ADVISORY_CHECKS's
own sense", validated by "does grep compile it". What grep accepts and how it reads it depends on
which grep (GNU on Linux, BSD 2.6 on macOS: ``\\b``, ``\\d``, an unmatched ``)``), on the caller's
locale (in a UTF-8 locale BSD grep refuses a range such as ``[+-.]`` that the C locale accepts), and
on newlines in the pattern (each line is a pattern of its own, OR-ed). An earlier port translated
the ERE to ``re`` inside an allowlist and read anything outside it as matching nothing; a parity
review showed that is not the stricter gate -- an advisory check missed counts as a build check, so
a head the shell read as ABSENT read as green. So grep is asked, per name, with the caller's
environment, exactly as ``is_advisory`` and ``ere_valid`` asked it; grep is resolved on PATH like
every other tool (``proc.run_tool``).
