"""``pr-review.sh merge <pr> [--override <reason>] [--wait[=s]] [--allow-no-verdict] [--require-green]
[-- <gh pr merge args...>]``: read the build signal, then merge the head it was read for.

Ported from the shell's ``cmd_merge`` with ``refuse_merge_queue``, ``await_mergeable`` and
``absent_base_holds`` (ludics-lite#403). The gate and the merge are one command on purpose
(ahrefs/ocannl#694: a gate you have to remember to run separately is the gate that was missing for
seven merges). The order of the reads is the shell's, and it is load-bearing -- each position was a
review round:

  the body's closing-keyword scan (lead time), the merge queue (a close-out merge), the advisory
  list, the gate (with the override's waiver), the close-out refusals, the base drift; then before
  EVERY attempt: the body again, the commit series, the open review threads, the merge queue last,
  and an ABSENT verdict's base (ludics-lite#523); then the call, bound to the gated head
  (``--match-head-commit``), and the merged state confirmed over REST.

Exit: 0 merged; 1 refused (red, a moved head, a real conflict, an open thread, a deferred merge);
2 usage; 3 something that decides it could not be read; 4 no verdict; 5 the head was superseded.
