"""``pr-review.sh reply``: answer a review thread, or a whole folded entry, from one invocation.

    reply <pr> <comment-id>[+<comment-id>...] <body> [--allow-mention]
    reply <pr> <comment-id>[+<comment-id>...] --anchor <comment-id>

Ported from the shell's ``cmd_reply`` and its helpers (``split_ids``, ``ids_from``, ``ids_token``,
``thread_url``, ``post_reply``, ``reply_failed``, ``mention_refusal``); ludics-lite#403. The
incident history these rules come from is in the shell's comments at the commit before the port
and in ship-pr/scripts/test-pr-review-reply.sh, which pins every one of them.

- The comment-id argument is the token poll RENDERS: ``900`` for one thread, ``900+901+902`` for a
  folded entry (ludics-lite#76). The body goes to the ANCHOR (the first id), and each duplicate
  gets a one-line pointer to the anchor's reply, so a duplicate costs no composed answer of its
  own. The WHOLE token is matched against its grammar before anything is split off it (round 1 of
  #86: a split that word-split or globbed turned "900 901" or "*" into comment ids).
- ``--anchor <id>``: the answer already stands in that thread, so no body is taken and every id in
  the token is pointed at it. It is the retry a batch that failed part-way hands back (round 3 of
  #86): handing back the plain remainder would promote its first id to anchor and post the
  composed answer a second time.
- A reply is the one write here that cannot be repeated safely, so a failure says what LANDED and
  what to retry with, and the progress turns on the classification as well as on how far the
  batch got: a gateway refusal and a rejection posted nothing for that id, an ambiguous failure
  (a 500, a dropped connection) may have, and is stated as the question it is, with both answers
  (round 2 of #86).
- A body mentioning '@codex' is refused before any request, unless ``--allow-mention``
  (ludics-lite#472); see ``mention_refusal``.

Stdout: each reply's html_url, one per line, in the order they were posted. Exit: 0 every reply
posted; 1 the API rejected one (a 4xx); 2 usage; 3 a gateway refusal on every attempt, or an
ambiguous failure.
