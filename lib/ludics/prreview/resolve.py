"""``pr-review.sh resolve <pr> <comment-id>[+<comment-id>...]``: close every review thread the token
names, each answered on its own line.

Ported from the shell's ``cmd_resolve``, ``resolve_one``, ``find_thread``, ``thread_page`` and the
walk they read through, ``threads_walk`` (ludics-lite#403). The token is ``reply``'s, so a folded
entry is closed by one invocation too. Unlike a reply, this is safe to repeat whole: the mutation is
idempotent and an already-resolved thread costs no write.

Threads are addressed by node id, which is only reachable by matching a thread's FIRST comment, by
the id the open-thread gate names it by (``fullDatabaseId``, the BigInt string, ahead of
``databaseId``, a 32-bit Int while review comment ids already run past 2^31; review of #370). The
lookup reads the same connection as the gate, through the same walk, to the same page cap, so
every thread the gate can name is one ``resolve`` can reach (round 1 of #370's review: the two once
paged to different caps). "Not found" is concluded only when EVERY page came back and the rows add
up to the PR's totalCount: a short read is a hole the id could be hiding in (9197c23: a 503'd page
announced "no review thread starts at comment N" for three threads that all existed).

Stdout: ``true`` for one id; ``<id> true`` per id for several; ``true (already resolved)`` for a
thread already closed. Exit: 0 every thread is closed; 1 no thread starts at that comment, or the
API rejected the mutation; 2 usage, or GraphQL rejected the lookup (about the query, not the id);
3 the lookup or the mutation did not complete. Every refusal past the first id names the ids
already closed by this invocation.
