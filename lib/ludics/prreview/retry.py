"""``pr-review.sh retry [--read|--write] [gh] <gh args...>``: any other gh call, under this script's
retry policy, instead of a hand-rolled loop.

Ported from the shell's ``cmd_retry`` (ludics-lite#403). The 2026-08-17 outage had a session
hand-rolling ``for i in 1 2 3`` around ``gh pr comment`` and ``gh pr merge`` five separate times.
The default is the WRITE policy (gateway refusals only, so a merge or a comment cannot be sent twice
from an ambiguous error); ``--read`` opts into the broader one for a plain GET. A leading ``gh``,
as a caller pastes it, is tolerated. ``run watch`` is never forwarded to gh: it is the quiet await
in ``runwatch``.

The caller's arguments are classified as a CALLER's (``GhSession.retry_caller``): gh refusing them
on a command path that runs nothing but gh's own parse and API calls (``gh_api_only_command``,
ludics-lite#452) sent nothing, so it is a usage error on the first attempt; on any other path (an
alias, an extension, a subcommand that runs git) the same line is not read as gh's.

Stdout: gh's own, on success. Exit: 0 done; 1 the API rejected it (a 4xx, or a GraphQL error no
retry can change, ludics-lite#422); 2 usage, or gh refused the arguments and sent nothing; 3 the
API never answered, or a write failed ambiguously -- the outcome is UNKNOWN, never a failure of the
command's job.
