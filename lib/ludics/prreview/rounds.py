"""``pr-review.sh rounds <pr>``: how many review rounds carried findings, against the threshold.

Ported from the shell's ``rounds_line``, ``count_token`` and ``cmd_rounds`` (ludics-lite#403); the
count itself is ``state.review_rounds``, the one port of ``review_rounds``. A round is a burst of the reviewer's
COMMENTED (or CHANGES_REQUESTED) reviews on one head, or a comment-only round, in submission
order: a new round starts on a different head (a prefix of the other counts as the same) or more
than SHIP_PR_ROUND_GAP seconds after the previous item. Not rounds: pending reviews, the author's
own replies, the round-started placeholder, a no-findings verdict, an initialization failure
(either shape), and an empty envelope holding nothing but the connector's fixed reply.

Stdout: the count line, then the trailer ``rounds: n=<count|unknown> threshold=<n|off>``.
Exit: 0 at or under the threshold (or none set), 1 past it, 3 the count could not be read.
