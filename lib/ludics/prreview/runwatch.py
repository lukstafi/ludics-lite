"""``pr-review.sh retry [--read] run watch <owner/name#run-id> [-R owner/name] [-i seconds]``: a quiet
await of ONE workflow run, which is never forwarded to ``gh run watch``.

Ported from the shell's ``cmd_run_watch`` (ludics-lite#403); ``retry`` hands it everything after
``run watch``.

Why not gh's: its nonzero exit on a run that concluded FAILURE carries no HTTP status, so the retry
policy read a workflow VERDICT as transport -- four attempts re-watching a run that had already
completed, then "the API never answered" -- and in a non-TTY shell its progress redraws accumulate
(~168k tokens in one session; the 2026-08-29 wave, self-improve#8). So this polls ``gh run view`` on
the checks cadence, prints a heartbeat line on stderr instead of redraws, and ends with ONE verdict.

The run is addressed the way a PR is -- owner/name#<run-id>, through the same ``parse_ref`` -- and
the repo is NEVER inferred from the cwd (ludics-lite#74: a background shell started in another
project's worktree turned a wrong-target 404 into a FAILED-run verdict). A bare id needs -R or
REPO=; an argument repo and an -R that disagree are refused, not resolved either way. Every flag
outside the ones below is refused too: a catch-all that discarded an argument turned a mistyped repo
flag into a watch of whatever REPO named. The sleep is capped at what is left of the deadline (an
-i past it slept the await far beyond its ceiling), and the interval is at least a second (0
busy-looped the API).

Exit codes, matching ``checks``: 0 the run succeeded; 1 it concluded failure -- a VERDICT, so do not
retry the watch, read the run; 2 the invocation is wrong (no repo named, a malformed argument or
flag, or a run/repo pair the API rejects); 3 the API did not answer, so the run's state is UNKNOWN;
4 no verdict -- still running at the deadline, or stopped without being judged.
