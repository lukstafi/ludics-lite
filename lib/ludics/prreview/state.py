"""The reviewer's state as `status` and every `watch` exit report it.

Ported from pr-review.sh's ``status_state`` (the state machine over the reactions, the reviews,
the comments and the head), ``status_line`` and ``conflict_note`` (its rendering), the open-thread
check an approval passes through (``threads_walk``, ``unresolved_threads``, ``threads_named``,
``approval_gate``, ``gated_state``) and ``review_rounds``/``count_token``. The shell's comments on
each carry the incidents behind every comparison; the order of the reads and of the arms below is
theirs, and it is load-bearing (the head is read AFTER the feeds; the comments BEFORE the reviews).

A state line was ``token|age|mergeability|detail``. Here it is ``State``; ``detail`` keeps the
shell's string, with the leading ``|`` fields the ``failed``, ``nudged`` and ``unresolved`` tokens
carry.
