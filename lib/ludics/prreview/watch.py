"""``pr-review.sh watch <pr> [watermark]``: wait for the reviewer's next round, and say what it was.

Ported from ``cmd_watch``, ``watch_loop`` and their helpers (``watch_round``, ``watch_note_past``,
``watch_quiet_line``, ``watch_act``, ``watch_round_counts``/``_trailer``/``_note``,
``watch_settle``, ``watch_preserve_unarmed_nudge``, ``watch_end``, ``watch_grace_deadline``,
``watch_post_request``, ``item_about_head``, ``tmp_sweep_stale``). The shell's comments above each
of them carry the incidents behind every rule kept here -- they are pr-review.sh as of the port's
parent commit (``git show 14f2ca7:ship-pr/scripts/pr-review.sh``); read them before changing one:

- the wait ends only on reviewer activity ABOUT the head being watched (ludics-lite#72); items
  about another commit are printed for the record on stderr and the watermark moves past them;
- every verdict that says "nothing is coming" polls once more first, re-reads the state, and is
  withheld (exit 3) when either did not answer -- a nudge over a round that just landed clears
  the 👍 it was about to get;
- "keep waiting" is said only while something runs: a live round or a fresh nudge extends the
  window ONCE, to a frozen deadline (handed off once from a nudge's pickup to its review);
- a `failed` run is re-requested by the watch itself, once per head per process, on a state read
  fresh after the round, and the request is sent ONCE whatever its error (it may have landed).

Exit: 0 something to act on (a round, an approval, a verdict); 1 a quiet window; 3 the window, its
tail or the verdict's re-reads were not observed. The last stdout line is always the watermark.
