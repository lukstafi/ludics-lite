# CI's lint job, runnable before you push. Every assertion the `lint` job of
# .github/workflows/skill-scripts.yml makes lives here, and the job runs it by calling this script
# rather than by restating it -- so what a push is judged by and what the local loop runs are one
# command, and a change to either is a change to both (ludics-lite#221, #123).
#
# Usage: preflight.sh [--root DIR] [--require-tools] [--as-ci] [--guards all|changed|none]
#                     [--base REF] [STEP|GUARD...]
#        preflight.sh steps | globs | files | guards
#
# With no STEP it runs them all, each one whether or not an earlier one failed -- the workflow's
# `if: !cancelled()` shape -- and prints a summary. Exit 0 when nothing failed, 1 when something
# did, 2 on a usage error or a scope that describes nothing.

#                      tree the scope is what git holds, which is what a push carries)
#   - modes            the two-way mode rule: a script is executable, an *.example.sh is not
#   - shellcheck       shellcheck --severity=error --external-sources over the same list
#   - powershell       pwsh parses scripts/*.ps1, and refuses to judge zero of them

#   - parse-fixtures   scripts/test-check-parse-guards.sh
#   - prompts          scripts/check-prompts.sh (the prompt-hygiene job's check, not lint's:
#                      a missing register line for a new suite is the other thing a push goes red
#                      for, and it is free to run here)

#                      them too, so leaving them out here made the local command a subset of CI)
#   - jq-version       the jq on PATH is the fleet's minor, 1.8 (ludics-lite#508), and says which
#                      jq it found and where
#
# THE GUARDS are the other half of a push's verdict: the suites of CI's `small guards (ubuntu)`
# job (`prompts` in the workflow) that the steps above do not already run. A prose edit to a skill
# can pass every step here and still fail one of them -- PR #544 dropped a literal that
# test-check-prompts.sh needs ship-pr/SKILL.md to carry, and went red in CI after a clean
# preflight (ludics-lite#553). They are not steps, because they take minutes rather than seconds
# and most pushes cannot break them; which of them run is --guards MODE:
#   - changed  (the default when no STEP is named) each guard with a file trigger runs when a
#              tracked file matching it differs from the merge base of --base REF (default
#              origin/main) and HEAD -- committed, staged or only edited, since that is what the
#              push will carry. A checkout where that cannot be told (no such REF, not a git
#              work tree) runs them: a guard skipped on a guess is the miss this exists to end.
#   - all      every guard, which is what the small-guards job runs on every head.
#   - none     no guard (the default when a STEP is named, so `preflight.sh syntax` stays one
#              step and CI's lint job, which names its steps, runs none).
# A GUARD named on the command line runs whatever the mode. The table (`preflight.sh guards`):
#   - prompt-fixtures      scripts/test-check-prompts.sh, on any *.md: check-prompts.sh reads
#                          every SKILL.md, both index READMEs and (its slot count) every *.md, and
#                          its suite reads the live ship-pr/SKILL.md's shape -- wider than the
#                          ship-pr/, issue-wave/ and routines/ the issue named, which miss the
#                          root README and the other skills
#   - routines-fixtures    scripts/test-sync-routines.sh, on routines/*.md: its pin compares the
#                          routines table with sync-routines.sh
#   - reporters            scripts/test-workflow-reporters.py   } no file trigger: a Markdown
#   - nudge-fixtures       ship-pr/hooks/test-ship-pr-nudge.py  } edit cannot break them, so they
#   - base-helper-fixtures scripts/test-run-against-base.sh     } run under --guards all or by
#   - py-wrapper           scripts/test-py.sh                   } name, and CI runs them always
# scripts/test-preflight.sh pins the table to the job: every guard is a step of it, and every
# step of it is a guard or one of the steps above.
#
# MISSING TOOLS. Without --require-tools a step whose interpreter is absent is SKIPped by name and
# does not fail the run: pwsh is on neither fleet mac, and a preflight that goes red for a tool
# the reader cannot install is a preflight the reader stops running. CI passes --require-tools, so
# an image that loses pwsh or shellcheck is a red step there rather than a quiet pass. A step named
# on the command line is still only skipped under that rule -- the flag, not the form, decides.
#
# A WRONG jq IS A WARNING HERE AND A FAILURE IN CI, by the same flag. jq 1.7.1 and 1.8 parse
# `A and X as $b | B` differently, and macos-latest's 1.8 turned a PR red that no fleet box could
# reproduce on its 1.7.1 (ludics-lite#508), so the fleet and CI run 1.8. Locally another minor is
# a named WARN that leaves the exit status alone: no step here evaluates a jq program, so the
# box's jq changes none of this script's verdicts, and a red the push will not have is what teaches
# the reader to stop running the preflight. The warning is for the suites, which do run jq, and it
# names the jq it found and where -- on mac-studio a clean `bash -l` puts /usr/bin (Apple's 1.7.1)
# before Homebrew's. Under --require-tools, which is where CI pins the binary, it is red.
#
# --root DIR judges DIR instead of this script's own checkout. It is how scripts/test-preflight.sh
# puts a defective tree in front of each assertion; nothing else needs it.
#
# --as-ci exports GITHUB_ACTIONS=true for the run, so a refusal takes the `::error file=` annotation
# form the lint job prints instead of the sentence, and every step script inherits the variable
# the way it does on a hosted runner. It exists because a control can read that variable by
# accident and pass everywhere but CI: PR #275's `preflight fixtures` step went red on exactly
# that, and no local run could reproduce it until the fixture was rewritten. It does not imply
# --require-tools; pass both to run what CI runs.
#
# `steps` prints "name<TAB>command<TAB>tool" per step (`-` for one implemented here, an empty tool
# for one that needs nothing beyond this shell), `globs` the file-list
# patterns, `files` the paths they expand to in the judged checkout, `guards`
# "name<TAB>command<TAB>trigger" per guard (an empty trigger for one with none). They are the read-only half of
# "one place": scripts/test-preflight.sh pins the step table against the lint job's steps, and
# issue-wave/scripts/test-fleet-worker.sh reads `globs` for its lint-coverage guard rather than
# re-deriving the list from the YAML the way it did while the list lived there.
