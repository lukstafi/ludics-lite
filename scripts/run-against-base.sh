#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs the working tree's version of ONE suite against the base code: the negative control every
# issue-wave brief asks for ("show the new fixtures FAIL on the base"). A detached worktree of
# origin/main (or --base <ref>) is made under $TMPDIR, the current working tree's copy of
# <suite-path> -- that file, and only the files named with --also -- is copied over the base's,
# and the suite runs from the base worktree, so everything else it reaches through its own
# directory is the base's. The
# worktree is a real checkout, not a `git archive` export, so a suite that asks git about its
# checkout gets an answer. It is removed on every exit path, INT and TERM included.
#
# Before 2026-09-28 each worker did this by hand, each differently: a detached worktree with the
# test copied in, a `git archive` of the base (which broke a case, since an export is not a git
# checkout), the edited script stashed back to base, temporary worktrees.
#
# It is a suite run like any other, so callers take the box's correctness slot around it:
#   ~/.claude/skills/issue-wave/scripts/fleet-worker.sh execution slot -- \
#     scripts/run-against-base.sh <suite-path> [--base <ref>] [suite args...]
# (`execution slot --cpu -- ...` for a suite that holds no GPU).
#
# The base ref is used as it stands locally: fetch first if origin/main may be stale.
#
# Usage: run-against-base.sh <suite-path> [options] [suite args...]
#   <suite-path>     a file in the current checkout's working tree (relative to the cwd, or
#                    absolute)
# The options come right after the suite path, in any order; the first word that is not one of
# them, and every word after it, goes to the suite (`--` included: it is the suite's).
#   --base <ref>     the base to run against (default origin/main; with --mutate, the working tree)
#   --also <path>    carry this working-tree file into the base too, at the same path: a fixture
#                    library the suite changed with (ludics-lite#501). Repeatable. Everything not
#                    named is still the base's.
#   --mutate <file> <sed-expr>
#                    a MUTANT run: after the copies, apply `sed -e <sed-expr>` to <file> inside
#                    the throwaway worktree -- never to the live tree, so an interrupted run
#                    leaves nothing to restore. Without --base the worktree is a snapshot of the
#                    working tree (`git stash create`: tracked files, staged or not; untracked
#                    ones are not in it), since a mutant is of the change, not of the base. An
#                    expression that changes nothing is refused: that is not a mutant. Repeatable,
#                    applied in order. A tests-only change takes this control instead of the
#                    base's: its new cases pass on the base too (ludics-lite#501).
#   --timeout <s>    stop the suite after <s> whole seconds (default RUN_AGAINST_BASE_TIMEOUT, or
#                    0: none). On expiry its process group gets TERM, then KILL after the grace,
#                    and the run is reported as the base FAILING, exit 124: a hang is a valid
#                    negative control for a fix that ends one, not a refusal (ludics-lite#501).
# Exit: the suite's own exit status; 124 when the timeout expired; 125 when the helper could not
# run it at all, could not start it (exec failed: it never ran), or could not clean up after it
# (the `git bisect run` convention for "cannot test"), so a refusal is never read as the suite's
# failure -- and a suite's own 125 is reported as 1, as is its own 124 when a timeout is armed.
# Whatever the suite left running is stopped with it: its process group gets TERM, then KILL
# after RUN_AGAINST_BASE_GRACE whole seconds (default 5).
