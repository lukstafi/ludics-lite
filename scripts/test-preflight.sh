# script carries, each with the tree that must PASS beside it. Until ludics-lite#123 these
# assertions were inline `run:` shell in the lint job, so nothing could put a defective tree in
# front of them -- the mode rule's two directions were pinned once, by hand, in a session
# transcript (ludics-lite#121), and the parse guard ran only against two files that already
# satisfied it, which is a guard that could stop guarding in silence.
#
# It ends on the pin that keeps the job and the script one set of checks: every `run:` in the lint
# job is preflight.sh or a command in its step table, and every command in that table is run
# somewhere in the workflow. A step added to one side and not the other fails here, and so does a
# lint step rewritten back into inline shell -- its `run: |` is a command word the table cannot

# --- the pin: the lint job and the step table are one set of checks ---------------------------
#
# THE READER these six share, so they cannot disagree about what the workflow says. What it
# answers is one question -- is THIS step an invocation of THIS command that a failure of the
# command would fail the job over? -- and eight rounds of this review went into the ways a step
# can look like one without being one. Three rules carry all of them:
#
#   1. A STEP IS DECIDED WHOLE, at its boundary, not at its `run:` line. A YAML mapping is
#      unordered, so `run:` above `continue-on-error: true` is the same step as the other way
#      round, and a reader that emitted at the run line called the first one live (round 12).
#   2. WHAT A PINNED STEP MAY CARRY IS AN ALLOW-LIST -- `name:`, `run:`, `id:`, and an `if:` that
#      is `${{ !cancelled() }}` -- and a job may carry `name:`, `runs-on:`, `timeout-minutes:`
#      and that same `if:`. Rounds 6 to 12 each named one more key that neuters a step or a job
#      (`continue-on-error:`, `shell: bash -n {0}`, `working-directory:`, `env:`, `needs:`, a
#      `defaults:` block setting the shell), and that supply is not exhausted while Actions grows
#      keys. Inverting the rule closes the class by construction; a step or job that legitimately
#      needs another key gets a loud refusal here, which is one deliberate line to answer.
#   3. A KEY IS FOUND BY INDEX AND BY PLACE. `run:`, `if:` and the rest may each open a step
#      behind the list dash (`- run: x`), which is valid YAML this workflow already uses (round
#      9); and a `run:` key is only a command when it stands in the `steps:` list of a job, so a
#      job output or an environment value spelled `run: scripts/check-prompts.sh` is not a check
#      anyone runs (round 12).
#
# A BARE invocation additionally has nothing after the command word. That rule was three rounds
# of failure-handler grammar (`|| { ...; exit 1; }` by substring, then anchored, then defeated by
# `|| { echo exit 1; }`) before the tolerance was removed outright: every command in the step
# table already has a plain line somewhere -- the lint job runs each of its checks bare, and the
# prompt hygiene job runs check-prompts.sh bare -- so the grammar was buying nothing.
