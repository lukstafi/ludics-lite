# is, which is what the polling deadlines have to survive. $SSH_DOWN_AFTER (with $SSH_DOWN_LIST
# naming a scratch file) makes a destination go unreachable partway through a run. $SSH_REFUSE
# names a command substring
# that fails even on a reachable destination: a Windows host that answers ssh but whose
# `wsl.exe --shutdown` fails, say. $SSH_HANG is an extended regex over the whole `<dest> :: <cmd>`
# line, and a match WEDGES instead of answering -- the 2026-09-16 shape, where the far side
# accepts the connection and the remote command never returns, which ConnectTimeout does not bound
# and only the script's own cap can end. A regex rather than a substring because the cases below
# need to wedge one box's Windows aliases while leaving its guest and its neighbour answering. It
# is an `exec sleep`, not a `sleep`, so that the cap's SIGALRM lands on the sleeping process itself
# rather than on a shell waiting for a foreground child.
# Commands that have OUTPUT the script reads, and only a reachable destination produces it:
# $SSH_TASKLIST is what `tasklist` prints, $SSH_REG is what `reg query` prints, and
# $SSH_WSL_STOPPED makes `wsl.exe --list --running` report no running distribution.
#
# The HOLDER is modelled as two processes, and that is the whole point of this shim since
# ludics-lite#192. A real hold has a local ssh client and a remote process tree, the channel
# between them is the only thing that connects the two, and the defect was that killing the client
# did NOT end the tree: Windows sshd exits without reaping its children, and a holder that never
# reads its stdin never learns the channel is gone. A shim that answered the holder command in one
# process could not express that -- killing it ended everything -- which is exactly why the suite
# passed while both boxes leaked a tree per lane.
#
# So: the shim `ssh` is the CLIENT. It starts $SSH_REMOTE_HOLDER as a separate process whose stdin
# is a fifo of its own (the channel), pumps its own stdin into that fifo, and then does nothing but
# wait for the remote -- the way a real ssh exits when its remote command does. The client's TERM
# trap kills the PUMP and never the remote, because a real client has no reach into the remote tree
# either; the remote then sees EOF and ends itself, which is the contract the new holder is built
# on. $SSH_REMOTE_LEAKS=1 makes the remote ignore that EOF and keep running, which is Windows as
# measured on 2026-09-17, and is how the cases below get a leak to detect. $SSH_HOLD_LIFE makes the
# remote exit on its own after N seconds -- a holder that DIES under the lane, which is a different
# fault from one that outlives it.

# sweep's hip unit died 76 s into an unheld VM that had powered off 18 s after its kick
# (ludics-lite#155). An ssh session INSIDE the guest does not hold it, so the holder is a
# Windows-side `wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -e sh -s <token>`, and the VM counts as up only once that holder
# has SAID ITS TOKEN BACK from inside the guest -- a holder that failed to start is the exact state
# the flag exists to rule out, and counting wsl.exe in `tasklist`, which is what this observed
# until 2026-09-19, was true of the owner's console shell too (ludics-lite#184 (a)).
# A holder carries its box's lab lock for as long as it lives (that is the point: another
# session's restart is then refused rather than destroying the lane). In this suite that means a
# case which leaves a holder running would refuse every later case on that box, so each case that
