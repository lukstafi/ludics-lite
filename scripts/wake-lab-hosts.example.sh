# Template for the host table wake-lab.sh sources. Copy it to ~/.config/wake-lab/hosts.sh (or
# anywhere WAKE_LAB_HOSTS points), fill in the real values, and keep that copy out of git:
#
#   mkdir -p ~/.config/wake-lab
#   cp scripts/wake-lab-hosts.example.sh ~/.config/wake-lab/hosts.sh
#   chmod 600 ~/.config/wake-lab/hosts.sh && $EDITOR ~/.config/wake-lab/hosts.sh

# This is the only part of the lab's wiring that is site data rather than reviewable logic: the
# fleet's MAC addresses, LAN IPs, and booted operating-system kinds. Everything else — the lore, the router endpoints, the ssh
# aliases, the logic — is tracked in ludics-lite, so an in-place edit shows up in `git status`
# (ludics-lite#31). The MACs below are 00:00:00 placeholders on purpose; a real one in this file
# is a leak, and scripts/test-wake-lab.sh fails the repository if one appears. The IPs are
# likewise fictitious, from RFC 5737's documentation range (192.0.2.0/24) rather than from any
# real LAN: a template carrying the author's leases would be site data by another name.
#
# The box names must be the ones the script knows: rog, minix, tuf. Each function echoes
# the value(s) for a known box and returns 1 for anything else; all four are required.
# Sourced by a `set -u` script under bash 3.2: no associative arrays.

# Every MAC of a box, Wi-Fi and Ethernet. wake() sends a magic packet to each — the Wi-Fi ones
# never wake anything (see the lore in wake-lab.sh) but cost nothing and keep this table readable
# against the router's own host list. A Wi-Fi-only box gets one entry and can never be woken.
