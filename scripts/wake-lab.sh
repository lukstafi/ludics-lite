# Drive the home-lab machines' power state remotely: wake, sleep, hibernate, shut down, inspect.
#
# Waking uses two independent paths, both attempted:
#   1. FRITZ!Box TR-064 `X_AVM-DE_WakeOnLANByMACAddress` — the router emits the magic
#      packet on the wired LAN segment. No credentials needed from the LAN side.
#   2. A magic packet sent directly from this Mac (broadcast, UDP ports 7 and 9).
#
# Usage:
#   wake-lab.sh [rog|minix|tuf|all]       wake (default: rog minix; all: every box in the endpoint map)
#   wake-lab.sh --wait [--wsl] rog        wake, then poll until configured OS answers
#   wake-lab.sh --wait --restart-wsl rog  ...and start WSL from a FRESH VM (wsl --shutdown first)
#   wake-lab.sh status [box...]           per-box reachability and reached OS, whether each lab lock
#                                         is really held, and the box's execution reservations
#                                         (default: every box)
#   wake-lab.sh sleep|hibernate|down box  suspend / hibernate / full shutdown
#   wake-lab.sh kick-wsl box              start the WSL VM (it never autostarts at boot)
#   wake-lab.sh restart-wsl box           shut the WSL VM down and start it again
#   wake-lab.sh kick-wsl --hold box       ...and leave a Windows-side holder keeping the VM alive
#   wake-lab.sh unhold box                end that holder (a lane ends by unhold, never by expiry)
#   wake-lab.sh lock-path box             where that box's LANE lock lives, for a harness taking one
#   wake-lab.sh boot-windows [--as=ID] box  reboot a dual-boot box into Windows for ONE boot,
#                                         unattended, and wait until its Git Bash answers; refused
#                                         while an execution reservation other than ID names the box
#                                         (see "dual boot" below)
#   wake-lab.sh boot-linux box            ...and back: reboot it (or wake it) into Ubuntu; both are
#                                         reboots, so a desktop session's open apps close with them
#   wake-lab.sh --list                    dump the router's host table
# WSL and Windows hardware notes live with the adapter in scripts/wake-lab-wsl.sh.
#
# Every path that takes a box away from whatever is running on it -- `restart-wsl` and
# `--restart-wsl`, which shut the VM down host-globally, and `sleep`/`hibernate`/`down` and the two
# `boot-*` verbs, which take the whole host -- RESERVES the box first and refuses one another tool is using. The reservation is
# held across the destructive command rather than checked before it, because a check and an act
# with a gap between them is the race this exists to close. It spans BOTH of that box's lab locks
# -- the lane lock and the hold lock, which say two different things and are held by two different
# kinds of user -- and `--force` overrides both. The lab lock lore below says which is which, why
# there are two, when `--force` is the right call, and what each cost the day it was not there.
#
# Tracked in the ludics-lite repository as scripts/wake-lab.sh and meant to be reached through a
# ~/bin/wake-lab.sh symlink, so an edit made mid-run lands as a normal `git status`. One part is
# deliberately NOT tracked: the fleet's MAC and LAN IP addresses, which live in a site file this
# script sources at startup — ~/.config/wake-lab/hosts.sh, or wherever WAKE_LAB_HOSTS points. It
# defines mac_of, eth_mac_of, ip_of and kind_of, and the script refuses to run without it;
# scripts/wake-lab-hosts.example.sh in the checkout is the template. Everything else — the lab
# lore below, the router endpoints, the ssh aliases, all of the logic — is tracked and reviewable.

# Verified lab constraints. Do not spend a session rediscovering them; the dates say when each
# was last checked.
#
# * WoL works over Ethernet only, never over Wi-Fi: a magic packet cannot reach the Wi-Fi NIC of
#   a powered-off machine. Both MACs are in the host table and packets go to both, but the
#   Ethernet one does the waking. rog and minix are both CABLED (rog Ethernet .30, minix
#   Ethernet .31; minix's old .27 Wi-Fi lease is inactive). tuf (formerly asus-amd) is Wi-Fi
#   only and needs manual wake (flotilla PR #3), though native Linux SSH can be checked after it resumes.
# * Both boxes wake from a full shutdown (S5), not just from sleep — verified 2026-08-15 on both,
#   after enabling the `Wake Up` item on minix's BIOS SECOND setup screen (not under Advanced).
#   "Powered off" is a normal starting state for a wake, not a reason to expect failure.
# * `status` -> router-active is the router's NewActive bit for the box's Ethernet MAC, read over
#   TR-064 -- the router's opinion of the lease, not NIC telemetry, and the column is named for
#   what it reads so that it is not mistaken for link state. It is a fast UP signal and a SLOW
#   DOWN signal: for several minutes after a shutdown or hibernate, router-active=1 is a stale
#   DHCP lease aging out, and diagnosing the wake path from it is a misdiagnosis (2026-09-01);
#   wait for it to settle first. Once settled after a full shutdown, router-active=1 means the
#   NIC still holds Ethernet link while powered off: the WoL-armed state that makes the wake
#   possible. A failed wake then means the magic packet was ignored: check the BIOS WoL option
#   and the NIC wake settings of the OS last running on the box. With settled router-active=0 after
#   a full shutdown, check the cable, the box's power, and the BIOS setting that keeps the NIC
#   powered in S5.
# mac_of (every MAC of a box), eth_mac_of (the Ethernet one alone, whose lease is what
# router_active asks the router about) and ip_of are NOT here: they are the fleet's hardware

# found one that had been missed -- a Windows endpoint that passed WSL validation with no guest
# alias, and a status that never probed the renamed box's Windows boot. An endpoint names the OS it
# reaches:
#   linux  native Ubuntu                  win  the Windows host's sshd, over Tailscale
#   wsl    the WSL guest on that host     lan  the same Windows sshd over the direct LAN route,

# A row lists every OS the box can boot, whatever kind_of says it is set to today: kind_of is the
# site's current setting (hosts.sh), this is which endpoints exist, and status probes the others so
# that a dual-boot box which booted the other OS says so. The short box names, first on each row,
# are the WoL and lock identities, and the rows in order are the lab: `all` and a bare `status`
# expand to them. Adding or renaming a box is one row here plus its hosts.sh entries (and, for a

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the lab locks
# `wsl.exe --shutdown` is HOST-GLOBAL: it destroys the whole WSL2 VM, so every session on that box
# dies with it -- an in-flight sweep unit, and whatever terminals the operator had open. kick_wsl's
# own note ("the shutdown lands on the Windows host, never inside the VM, so it cannot kill the
# session issuing it") is true and was exactly the blind spot: it reasons about the session ISSUING
# the shutdown and says nothing about every other session on the VM.
#
# On 2026-09-16 that cost the cross-machine sweep both GPU units. Sweep 20260916T074913Z was
# 13 minutes into rog-nv/cuda and minix/hip when a second session, verifying a fix to THIS script
# against the real lab, ran `wake-lab.sh --wait --restart-wsl rog minix` at 08:02:30Z. Both guests
# rebooted (08:02:37Z, 08:02:40Z -- three seconds apart because the restart above is concurrent)
# and both units died on a reset connection seconds later. The sweep logged it as `error`, which
# reads as a box fault, and the failure was misattributed to the GPU autotune tests for two days:
# they are the longest-running tests in the suite, so a randomly-timed external kill lands in them
# far more often than anywhere else.
#
# So the boxes are a SHARED resource and destroying one needs an interlock. But "this box is in
# use" turned out to be TWO claims, and one exclusive file could not carry both of them:
#
#   "do not destroy this VM"        -- what `--hold` says, on behalf of whatever will run there
#   "no other lane runs here"       -- what a sweep lane says, so two lanes cannot fight over a box
#
# While both lived in one flock, a lane could not sweep the box its own holder was keeping alive.
# The cross-machine sweep routine holds rog and minix in step 1 and runs the sweep in step 2 of the
# same session, and on 2026-09-18 every remote lane waited out its 300 s LAB_LOCK_WAIT against that
# routine's own holder and then skipped: three of the five backends that routine is the only gate
# for got zero coverage, and the documented recovery (`kick-wsl --hold` then rerun) reproduced the
# skip exactly, because it took the same lock again (ludics-lite#224). The two halves had been
# designed as mutual exclusion between DIFFERENT sessions; one session doing both is not a
# contradiction to resolve but the intended shape, so the file is split rather than shared.
#
# Two files per box, each an ordinary EXCLUSIVE flock, in a directory this script and the sweep
# agree on. The contract is still deliberately nothing more than a directory, a filename and a
# one-line holder description: the sweep takes its own flock and does not need this script
# installed, which keeps a harness on another machine from depending on a symlink in ~/bin.
#
#   <dir>/<box>.lock        the LANE lock -- "no other lane runs on this box"
#   <dir>/<box>.hold.lock   the HOLD lock -- "this box's VM must not be destroyed"
#   first line of each      "<what> (pid <pid>, since <utc>)" -- advisory, for the refusal message
#
# Who takes which, and it is the whole design:
#
#   a sweep lane   the LANE lock, for the length of the lane
#   `--hold`       the HOLD lock, carried by the holder for exactly as long as the holder lives
#   a DESTROYER    (`restart-wsl`, `--restart-wsl`, `sleep`, `hibernate`, `down`) takes BOTH and is
#                  refused if EITHER is held -- each one alone means somebody loses work
#
# That keeps the 2026-09-16 property whole: another session's `restart-wsl` is refused while a lane
# is using the box, and refused just the same in the gap between a hold and the lane it was taken
# for, where there is no lane yet to refuse on its own behalf. What it drops is the one exclusion
# nobody ever wanted -- a hold and a lane no longer refuse each other.
#
# The LANE lock keeps the old name, the old format and the old semantics, so a sweep checkout that
# has not been updated still interlocks exactly as before. Worst case across a version skew is a
# spurious skip (an old sweep waiting out a new hold that no longer needs to block it), never a
# destroyed VM: neither side can be made to believe a box is free while the other is using it.
#
# flock and not a pidfile for the reasons sweep.sh gives about its own run lock: there is nothing
# to reclaim after a crash, no window between creating the lock and publishing ownership, and the
# kernel releases it when the holder dies however it dies. The holder line is advisory only -- it
# names who to go and look at, and a stale or missing one never decides anything.

# The whole power phase, with every box it acts on RESERVED from before its command is sent until
# that box is confirmed down.
#
# `hibernate` terminates the WSL VM outright (kick_wsl's note says so), `down` is a full host
# shutdown, and `sleep` suspends the host under whatever is running on it — all three destroy a
# reserved workload exactly as `wsl.exe --shutdown` does, so the interlock that covers the restart
# has to cover them too.
#
# And it has to cover the EFFECT, not the command. A dropped ssh means the suspend was INITIATED,
# not that the host is gone: for the seconds or minutes until it actually goes down the box still
# answers, so a reservation released when `power_action` returns lets another harness take the lock
# and start work that the pending transition then destroys. That is the restart's mistake one layer
# out — there the reservation did not cover the shutdown, here it did not cover what the shutdown
# does — so the rule this file holds is that a reservation spans the effect, never the command.
#
# THIS process holds every reservation, two descriptors each — the lane lock and the hold lock, as
# every destructive path takes both — and it is also the process that acts.
# An earlier version reserved box N at recursion level N, each level a subshell, so the descriptors

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- dual boot
# `boot-windows <box>` and `boot-linux <box>` reboot a dual-boot box into its other OS exactly once,
# with nobody at the keyboard, and wait until that OS answers (ludics-lite#353). A booted Windows
# box answers a native check in minutes, where a windows_only CI dispatch takes one to three hours.
#
# Selection is UEFI BootNext, never GRUB. `efibootmgr --bootnext <Windows Boot Manager>` makes the
# firmware start Windows for the ONE next boot and delete the variable as it does, so BootOrder
# (Ubuntu first on every box) and /etc/default/grub are never written; `grub-reboot` would have
# needed GRUB_DEFAULT=saved, and every box has GRUB_DEFAULT=0 (checked 2026-09-24). Coming back
# needs no selection at all: Windows' `shutdown /r /t 0` restarts into BootOrder's first entry,
# Ubuntu, and a dark box wakes into it the same way.
#
# Root on the Linux side is two commands, from a narrow sudoers file, /etc/sudoers.d/50-fleet-boot
# (its text is in README's lab-script section): `efibootmgr --bootnext <entry>` (with
# `--delete-bootnext`, to take the selection back when the reboot then fails, and a bare listing for
# a box whose EFI variables are not world-readable) and `systemctl reboot`. Every sudo is `sudo -n`,
# so a box without the file refuses at once instead of waiting on a password nobody will type.
#
# A reboot kills everything on the box, so both verbs RESERVE its lane and hold locks as
# power_phase does, from before the first command until the other OS answers or the deadline
# passes, and refuse while either is held; `--force` skips them with the same caveats. Both also
# refuse while an active execution reservation other than the caller's own names the box
# (boot_reservations_clear). boot-windows also refuses a box whose logind lists a sleep BLOCK inhibitor (sleep_blocks): that is a
# `fleet-worker.sh execution slot` or `hold` run in progress, which the lab locks do not see and a
# root `systemctl reboot` does not honour, since it inhibits sleep and not shutdown.
#
# The wait prints a line per poll with both OSes' state, and ends in a verdict:
#   exit 0  the requested OS answers (for Windows, its Git Bash as well)
#   exit 1  refused, or failed with the box reachable in a known OS: the reboot never took (and the
#           selection was taken back), or the box came back in the OS it left
#   exit 3  NEEDS A PERSON: nothing answers after the reboot. Only someone at the box can tell
#           Windows updates from a BitLocker recovery prompt or a hang, so this never retries.
# A box with no wired NIC in the site file (tuf) is refused: what cannot be woken remotely cannot
# be recovered remotely either.
