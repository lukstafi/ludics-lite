# Review-loop helpers for the ship-pr skill: poll a PR for NEW reviewer activity, reply to an
# inline comment, resolve its thread, and check the approval reaction.
#
# Every subcommand is served by Python since ludics-lite#403: lib/ludics/prreview/<subcommand>.py,
# run through scripts/py. This file is the command line in front of it -- the usage below, the
# source-time knobs and their validation, and the forward (see "the forward" at the foot). The
# notes that follow are the design the Python implements; each module there carries the incident
# history of its own rules. The shell implementation they were ported from is this file as of
# c66d06b (`git show c66d06b:ship-pr/scripts/pr-review.sh`).
#
# The point of the script is that the polling traps live in code instead of in prose:
#   - app reviewers appear as "<name>[bot]", so the login is matched by PREFIX, never equality;
#   - your own replies bump review and comment counts, so "new" means id > watermark, not a delta;
#   - the comment APIs paginate at 30, so every list call paginates with per_page=100;
#   - a just-submitted review shows up in pulls/<n>/reviews BEFORE its inline comments reach the
#     flat pulls/<n>/comments listing (2026-08-20, #396 review 4985620117: three findings readable
#     under the review's own comments endpoint while the flat list still omitted them, and the
#     round printed "(no new inline comments)" beside the review it had just detected) — so a
#     round that sees a new review re-reads pulls/<n>/reviews/<id>/comments and merges by comment
#     id, and a failure of THAT read fails the whole round rather than dropping the findings;
#   - the reviewer ANNOUNCES a round by posting a placeholder comment the moment it starts (the
#     machine-tagged codex-pull-request-review-summary table, "🔄 Running"), so a new id above the
#     watermark is not yet something to act on — it is dropped from the rendering while the
#     watermark still advances past it, or every PR's watch wakes once for a round that has not
#     finished (one wasted wake + re-arm per PR, observed landing self-improve#10 and #13);
#   - empty/non-numeric API output makes [ "$n" -gt 0 ] abort, so no count is compared as an int;
#   - the three feeds number their items in SEPARATE id spaces (a review id is ~4.9e9 while an
#     inline-comment id is ~3.8e9), so one shared watermark takes the max from reviews and then
#     hides every inline finding — the watermark is per feed, an opaque comma-joined triple;
#   - reviewThreads paginates at 100 too, so a long-running PR's later threads are unaddressable
#     ("no review thread starts at comment N") unless the resolve lookup pages to the end;
#   - a PR number names one PR in EVERY repository, so a repo that was not spelled out in the
#     invocation is a guess about intent that no read can check — the repo travels in the PR
#     argument (owner/name#number), and a bare number with no repo named is refused;
#   - an API failure and a genuinely empty feed both render as `[]`, so a read that failed must
#     report UNKNOWN and never "no approval yet" — that is a silent false negative on the merge
#     gate, and it fired for real during the 2026-08-17 GitHub outage on an approved PR;
#   - during an incident GitHub does not fail cleanly, it fails HALF the time: on 2026-08-17 about
#     one call in two came back "503 No server is currently available to service your request" for
#     an hour, so a single attempt is a coin flip and every call goes through the retry (core.py) — which
#     retries 5xx and that body text, and never a 4xx (a 4xx is the API answering);
#   - a call that exhausted its retries is a TRANSPORT failure, and reporting it as a fact about
#     the PR is the worst thing this script can do: "no review thread starts at comment N" was
#     printed during that outage for three threads that all existed, because the paginated GraphQL
#     lookup 503'd — it reads as a finding ("someone resolved it", "the id is wrong") and sends the
#     caller hunting. So every claim (no new activity, no such thread, not approved, wrong repo) is
#     printed ONLY on a call that succeeded; otherwise the message and the exit code say transport;
#   - a reaction is a LEVEL, not an event, and the app does not always take its 👀 back: on
#     2026-08-17 (#364) a 👀 added at 18:13:51Z outlived the review it announced (18:26:06Z), and
#     three consecutive 15-minute `watch` windows then reported "reviewing — wait it out" over a PR
#     nothing was reading. 45 minutes went to a signal carrying no information, and the loop only
#     moved after a hand-posted "@codex review". So a 👀 counts as in flight only while it is NEWER
#     than the reviewer's last word (a review OR its summary comment); once the reviewer has spoken,
#     the 👀 describes a round that has already landed and is spent;
#   - the reviewer posts one finding as several inline threads often enough to matter (round 11 of
#     ludics-lite#66: nine threads for four findings), and each duplicate then costs its own
#     composed reply and its own resolve — and it duplicates by RE-WRITING, so the copies share
#     their anchor exactly and share no byte of their text. So threads at the SAME anchor (path,
#     commit, author and every location field the row carries) fold into one entry listing every
#     thread id and printing every distinct body, and `reply`/`resolve` take that list, so a
#     duplicate costs one answer (ludics-lite#76);
#   - the reviewer's own utterances are that clock, NOT the head commit: a 👀 raised just before
#     your next push is a round that is genuinely running (seen live on #358 the same evening — 👀
#     at 20:34:13Z, head committed 20:35:01Z), so "older than the head commit" would declare an
#     in-flight round spent and nudge on top of it;
#   - whether the reviewer has SEEN the head is a SHA equality, not a time comparison: every review
#     records the commit_id it was submitted against, so comparing that to .head.sha answers the
#     question exactly — no guessing at a push time, and immune to a commit whose author date long
#     predates the push that delivered it;
#   - the same equality decides what ENDS a wait, and `watch` used to skip it: a new id above the
#     watermark is not the round you are waiting for unless it is about the head you are watching.
#     A round's watch exits on the inline findings and takes its watermark from that poll; the
#     reviewer's separate summary review lands seconds later with a higher id; and the next
#     window returns 0 on it immediately, with nothing about the new head to act on (ludics-lite
#     #72). So every item poll renders carries the commit it is about (a review's commit_id, an
#     inline comment's original_commit_id — commit_id MIGRATES to the current head as the branch
#     advances — and a comment's "Reviewed commit:" stamp), and one about another commit is
#     printed for the record while the watermark advances past it and the wait goes on;
#   - patience is bounded on BOTH sides, because a stall reads the same from either: a review
#     that never starts and a 👀 that never lands both end with a verdict to nudge rather than with
#     another silent hold. "Wait it out" is only honest while something is actually running — and
#     the verdict that nothing is coming polls ONE more time before it says so, because a nudge
#     recommended over a round that landed while the state was being read re-requests a review
#     and clears the 👍 it was about to get;
#   - how late a due review is cannot be read off the head commit's date alone: that date is
#     commit metadata, and a force-push to an older commit or a first push of a morning's work
#     predates the push it arrived in. The push time is not an API field, so the clock starts at
#     the newest of that date and the PR's created_at — a floor that cannot be wrong, since
#     nothing about a PR is due before the PR exists (ludics-lite#72, where a PR opened seconds
#     earlier reported its review "due for 22m" and recommended a nudge);
#   - the reviewer can fail at INITIALIZATION and say so in a plain summary comment, which is its
#     newest word without being a round at all: "Codex Review: Something went wrong. Try again
#     later by commenting “@codex review”." with "Provided git ref <sha> does not exist" in a
#     code block under it — no review, no findings, and no machine tag to tell it apart from a
#     verdict. On lukstafi/ocannl-staging#677 (2026-09-09) it landed twice, naming two heads that
#     `git ls-remote` and the PR's own head.sha both served: the reviewer's clone was behind, not
#     the push. Counted as the reviewer's last word it spends the 👀, and with no review of the
#     head the state fell to `expected`, so three consecutive windows recommended waiting out a
#     grace for a round that had already ended, while `rounds` counted the failed attempt as a
#     round with findings. Hence the `failed` state (prreview/state.py, ludics-lite#78), which
#     also covers the connector's "To use Codex here, create an environment for this repo"
#     (ludics-lite#421);
#   - and a round is only worth its cost on a head CI can test: GitHub creates no pull_request
#     workflow run for a PR whose merge commit it cannot build (mergeable_state `dirty`), while
#     the reviewer reviews it regardless. On ludics-lite#39 (2026-09-04) a sibling landed on main
#     during round 6 and rounds 6 through 12 each got findings, a "the next move is yours" from
#     `status`, and NO CI, over eight pushes and 80 minutes, until `merge` failed on it — one of
#     those pushes landed a broken test suite CI would have caught (ludics-lite#44). So `status`
#     reads mergeable_state off the same PR read as the head and says CONFLICTS on every state,
#     and `watch` prints the base-drift read the moment a round lands, not only at merge time.
#
# The `merge` command exists for the same reason as the rest of this file: what the merge step has
# to READ before it acts does not survive as prose. It reads the head commit's check-runs and
# REFUSES on a build check that concluded failure (ahrefs/ocannl#694 — seven merges onto a master
# that did not compile, each PR carrying its own red run), and it absorbs the merge traps: GitHub
# recomputes a PR's mergeability asynchronously after every push, and until that finishes `gh pr
# merge` fails with "Pull request is not mergeable: the merge commit cannot be cleanly created" —
# byte-identical to a genuine conflict. On ocannl-staging#373 (2026-08-18) that fired seconds after
# pushing the conflict-RESOLUTION merge commit; re-reading .mergeable moments later gave true and
# the retried merge landed. So it polls .mergeable over REST until it is non-null before calling
# that failure base drift (null = still computing; only a persisting false is a conflict), and it
# confirms `merged` over REST afterwards, because `gh pr merge` exits 0 having merely ENABLED
# auto-merge when the base carries required checks.
#
# The last thing `merge` reads before acting is how far the branch has fallen BEHIND its base and
# whether the base's advance touched any path changed by the PR, because a review is only ever
# about the code it was run against. On 2026-08-28
# (ocannl-staging#488) a merge was one keystroke away over a base 136 commits stale after SIXTEEN
# review rounds; master had meanwhile edited the very file the PR changed, and what caught it was a
# hand-run `git diff origin/master..HEAD --stat` whose 258 files and 14k deletions were visibly not
# the two-file branch. Nothing on the merge path had a reason to notice: the checks were green (on
# the stale head), the reviewer had approved (the stale diff), and `mergeable` was true (no textual
# conflict — semantic drift does not produce one). So the count is read from the compare API and
# WARNED about. It does not refuse — for one day (2026-08-29) it did, and the ahrefs/ocannl#861
# decision (2026-08-30) reverted that to the roll-forward policy: a clean merge proceeds on the
# head's green run, verification does not restart per sibling merge (the gate's cost was
# structural — #533 ran three full CI cycles over an unchanged diff), and what owns semantic
# drift after the fact is the wave coordinator's integration loop (issue-wave skill), which runs
# the full suites on merged master and stops the world on a regression. The overlap is exact or
# UNKNOWN: compare responses cap their file list at 300, so a capped list is never reported as
# "none". Both compare directions use the head SHA from one PR read and the base branch's tip
# from one read of the branch — NOT the PR's `.base.sha`, which is the base as of the last time
# GitHub could build the merge commit and so stands still on exactly the conflicted PR that is
# furthest behind (#39 read "0 behind" off it, 7 commits and 4 overlapping files behind) — and
# rename entries contribute both their current and previous filenames.
#
# REST vs GraphQL: everything on the polling and merge-gate path is REST, deliberately — GitHub's
# GraphQL endpoint 503s independently of REST, so a GraphQL-borne "no reaction yet" is a lie the
# merge gate would act on. `gh repo view` rides GraphQL, hence the local git-remote fallback.
# Thread resolution has no REST equivalent and stays on GraphQL, but reports transport failure as
# such instead of as "no such thread".

# Exit codes: 0 the command did what it says (and any fact it printed came from a call that
#             answered); 1 the fact does not hold (the window stayed quiet, no such thread, the API
#             rejected the request, a build check or a checkless workflow run is RED, the merge was
#             refused); 2
#             usage/configuration error; 3 TRANSPORT failure — nothing was learned, so retry rather
#             than concluding anything, which for `watch` includes a verdict WITHHELD because the
#             final poll or the state re-read behind it did not answer. 1 and 3 are kept apart
#             everywhere. `checks`, `base` and
#             `merge` add 4: no verdict yet — the build has not finished, every finished job was
#             cancelled, or a workflow run for the head is queued, running, stopped without a
#             verdict, or still to be created. 4 is not a pass and not a failure, and it is kept
#             apart from 0 for the same reason 3 is: "nothing has failed" and "everything passed"
#             are different facts.
#             From `merge`, 4 means the merge was REFUSED for want of a verdict (see
#             --allow-no-verdict). `checks` and `merge` add 5: SUPERSEDED — the PR head
#             moved from the observed SHA. Re-run to judge the successor; no override bypasses 5.
#
# Env: REPO=owner/name, overridden by a repo spelled out in the <pr> argument or by --repo; those
#      three are the ONLY sources, for every subcommand including `retry run watch` (`base`, which
#      resolves a repo and a branch rather than a bare number, still reads the cwd's checkout),
#      REVIEWER=login-prefix (default: codex app), WATCH_INTERVAL=seconds between polls (default
#      90), WATCH_TIMEOUT=seconds to watch (900), SHIP_PR_REVIEW_POLL_CAP and
#      SHIP_PR_BUILD_POLL_CAP=seconds the pause between unchanged polls doubles up to (300 for
#      `watch`, 600 for a `--wait`), SHIP_PR_STATE_DIR=where the quota hold and the observer locks
#      live (default ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/ship-pr; see prreview/budget.py), and
#      the runs pages of a `base --wait` that settled on absence (base-pages/, the newest 20),
#      SHIP_PR_API_ATTEMPTS=tries per gh call (4), SHIP_PR_API_BACKOFF=first pause in seconds (5,
#      doubling to a 20s cap: ~35s of retrying before a call is declared dead),
#      SHIP_PR_REVIEW_GRACE=seconds a due-but-unstarted review is waited for before `watch` returns
#      saying so (1200), SHIP_PR_REVIEW_STALL=seconds a live 👀 may run before it gets the same
#      verdict (2×GRACE). Both are measured from the PR's own timestamps, not from when the watch
#      started, so they are reached ACROSS windows — a 900s window cannot outrun a 1200s grace.
#      SHIP_PR_ADVISORY_CHECKS=ERE of check, job and workflow names the build gate ignores
#      (default: the review app's check and the github-pages deploys) — a run whose red is
#      explained entirely by advisory JOBS is not a red build signal either, and a run still in
#      flight whose every unfinished job is advisory does not hold a `--wait` once its finished
#      non-advisory jobs are all green and its job list has been still for a minute
#      (ludics-lite#500; prreview/gate.py). BOUNDARY: GitHub creates a
#      `needs:`-blocked job only once its dependencies finish, so a required job that `needs:` an
#      advisory one is not visible while that advisory job runs — such a workflow is released
#      early. A required job must not `needs:` an advisory one. A value REPLACES the default list,
#      so a caller that adds names spells the default's in too. A repository can set its own list
#      for `checks` and `merge` instead: one ERE per line in .github/ship-pr-advisory-checks on
#      its default branch, read before the gate (ludics-lite#530; prreview/gate.py). That keeps the
#      merge command bare. The variable, when set, still wins over the file, and `base` reads
#      only the variable and the default.
#      SHIP_PR_CHECKS_WAIT=seconds `--wait` holds
#      out for a build verdict (7200 — the runner queue alone ran ~2h deep on 2026-08-23),
#      SHIP_PR_CHECKS_INTERVAL=seconds between re-reads (60), SHIP_PR_CHECKS_HEARTBEAT=seconds
#      between the one-line "still waiting" progress notes a `--wait` prints (600),
#      SHIP_PR_BASE_ABSENT_GRACE=seconds a commit with no workflow run yet is allowed before its
#      absence is read as a fact (300; paths-ignore pushes never get one). `base --wait` applies
#      it to the tip — from the first READ of it, not from that round's last answer — and then
#      SETTLES for the older verdict the plain read settles for, once nothing is in flight on the
#      branch and no run for the tip exists to judge it. It settles at once, without the grace,
#      when every commit on the first-parent path from the judged one up to the tip changes only
#      paths within the workflow's own paths-ignore (ludics-lite#156). A `base --wait=N` in the
#      band (grace, grace+SHIP_PR_CHECKS_INTERVAL) is WARNED about: it reaches the settle only on
#      the single round the ceiling cap schedules, and only if the tip has not moved
#      (ludics-lite#175). `checks`/`merge` apply the
#      grace to the head before calling a build signal ABSENT rather than not-created-yet
#      (ludics-lite#24), and settle a run-less head at once on the same paths-ignore recognition,
#      walking the PR's own commits from its merge base (ludics-lite#176),
#      SHIP_PR_STALE_BASE=commits behind the base at which `merge` warns loudly (20; `off`
#      silences the commit-count warning). A nonempty file overlap still warns at any count; no
#      base-drift warning blocks the merge. SHIP_PR_ROUND_THRESHOLD=review rounds with findings
#      after which only BLOCKING findings are fixed and the rest go to one follow-up issue (12;
#      ship-pr's "When the loop ends" — `rounds` and `status` report the count against it,
#      nothing here enforces it; `off` reports the count alone; anything else is refused).
#      SHIP_PR_ROUND_GAP=seconds between two of the reviewer's reviews on the same head beyond
#      which they are separate rounds (900; a round's reviews land within seconds).

# --- jq's line ending (ludics-lite#335), for the scripts that source this file ------------------
# Nothing this file runs reads jq any more: every subcommand is Python. What is kept here is for the
# two kinds of script that SOURCE it and run jq themselves -- the fixture suites (their fixture
# `gh` answers through jq, and so do their reads of what a subcommand printed) and
# pr-review-api-contract.sh -- so the line ending is decided in one place for both. A native jq.exe on Windows (winget, Chocolatey,
# Scoop; Git for Windows ships no jq) writes its stdout in text mode and ends every line CRLF, and
# every line but a `$(...)`'s last keeps its \r. So the jq on PATH is asked ONCE, at source time:
#   lf      it writes LF already (every Unix jq, an MSYS2 jq): called as is, no cost;
#   binary  it writes CRLF and `-b` (jq 1.7+ on Windows) turns that off: called with `-b`, which
#           costs no process, where a filter would cost a fork per call on the slowest-forking
#           platform there is;
#   strip   it writes CRLF and refuses `-b` (jq 1.6): its output goes through `tr -d '\r'`. That
#           takes a CRLF inside a raw string to LF as well, which nothing reads as data. It is not
#           `sed 's/\r$//'`, which keeps that CRLF on Unix but lost it on the Git Bash leg all the
#           same, where MSYS sed read the \r away: the one platform that takes this path gets the
#           same answer either way, and tr says so.
# `jq_lf` is the call and `jq` names it, so a caller that replaces `jq` can forward to `jq_lf` and
# keep the line ending. A jq that is missing or broken probes as `lf`, and the first real call then
# fails as it would have. The probe runs only when the file is sourced (SHIP_PR_TEST_SOURCE_ONLY=1):
# a command line execs the Python, which reads no jq, and should not pay a jq process for it.
