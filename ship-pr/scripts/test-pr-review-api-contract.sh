# Fixture tests for pr-review-api-contract.sh (ludics-lite#91). The contract asks the live API
# what the fixture suites take on faith, so its OWN logic — which claims pin and which skip, the
# `pages` wrapper, the `is_list`/UNUSABLE fallbacks, the parent-count branch, how a failed read is
# sorted, and the cleanup on exit — was checkable only by finding a live anchor with the right
# shape. Here it runs against a fixture world instead, in two ways:
#
#   - SOURCED with CONTRACT_TEST_SOURCE_ONLY=1, in a child bash, which loads the helpers, the
#     scratch directory and the EXIT trap and stops before the first read: the helper cases.
#   - RUN whole, as its own process, with a fixture `gh` and `sleep` first on PATH: the world
#     cases. The contract is a script that sources pr-review.sh itself and runs under its own
#     errexit, so its `gh` has to be a command, not a function of this shell.
#
# The fixture `gh` answers `gh api <endpoint>` from one file per endpoint in a world directory,
# and nothing else — the boundary is a fail-closed allowlist: an endpoint with no file is a 404
# (the contract's exit 4), and an option, a header or an endpoint character outside the small set
# it models is a 400, so a request the contract changes can never be answered by a fixture that
# widened (the request-side drift of #103). The healthy case also holds the other direction:
# every answer in the world was asked for, so a read the contract stops making is a dead fixture
# this suite reports rather than one it keeps.
#
# The world's inline rows come from test-pr-review-lib.sh's shared builders, inline_comment and
# positional_comment, and the contract's own pins run over them: a builder that stops carrying a
# field the contract names fails the healthy case here (the response-side drift this issue's
# second half is about, for those two builders).
#
# The healthy case pins the whole list of verdict lines — every `ok`, `MOVED` and `skip` line,
# in order — so a claim that turns into a skip, or a new claim, changes this file in the same PR.

# One brace group over everything below the preamble, so bash parses the rest of this file WHOLE

# (ludics-lite#10, #247). The `{` opens BELOW the sources, not above them: bash binds a function's
# `declare -F` location when it PARSES the definition, so inside a group that also holds the
# sources every definition here is parsed first and the libraries' bindings land last -- and the
# shadow guard (ludics-lite#46) then reads every suite function as still the library's, refusing a

IFS= read -r -d '' HEALTHY_VERDICTS <<'EOF' || :
ok    repos/<owner/name> carries default_branch (the drift anchor's ref when none is given)
ok    commits/<encode_ref branch> answers the branch tip's sha and committer date (the drift anchor and the push clock)
ok    the feed is workflow_runs[]
ok    every row carries the fields the fold indexes: numeric id and workflow_id, string event, name and status, created_at (created_at and id are the sort key it orders on)
ok    every row's head_sha is the sha asked for (the filter filters)
ok    status strings are in the known vocabulary
ok    every row carries conclusion (present, null until completed) and it is in the vocabulary conclusion_class classifies
ok    a row that is not completed has no conclusion yet
ok    runs?head_sha= comes back newest-first (created_at non-increasing, on the tip's 2 rows)
skip  this job's own run is a row on its head, and that head is newest-first — not running under Actions (GITHUB_RUN_ID and CONTRACT_OWN_HEAD unset)
ok    workflow_id resolves to a workflow FILE whose name is the run's name (the fold keys on the file, not the display name)
ok    contents/<path> under the raw media type answers with the workflow file's own text, not the base64 JSON envelope
ok    the workflow list is workflows[], with total_count beside it
ok    every workflow carries the two fields the row projection reads: a numeric id and a non-empty name with no tab in it
ok    every workflow carries the path the paths-ignore read asks for, under .github/workflows/
ok    every workflow carries a state drawn from the vocabulary the head recognition reads (active = can create a run)
ok    this repository's workflows fit the single page cmd_base reads (1 of a page of 100)
ok    workflow 11's branch-and-event feed is workflow_runs[]
ok    every row carries the eight fields the fold projects: numeric workflow_id and id, string name and status, a 40-hex head_sha, an ISO created_at, and an html_url
ok    every row carries conclusion (present, null until completed), in the vocabulary conclusion_class classifies
ok    status strings are in the known vocabulary
ok    the workflow_id in the path is the workflow every row belongs to (the per-workflow query really is per workflow)
ok    the event= filter filters: every row is a push run
ok    the branch= filter filters: every row's head_branch is main
ok    the page comes back newest-first (created_at non-increasing over its 2 rows), so per_page=10 is the newest ten
ok    the feed is jobs[] (run 201, the latest red run: failure)
ok    jobs[] rows carry a non-empty name (run_red_is_advisory_only skips a row with none) and conclusion (present, null while unfinished)
ok    job conclusions are in the same vocabulary as run conclusions
ok    a red run's jobs carry the red: at least one job concluded failure, timed_out or startup_failure, or no jobs at all (the startup_failure shape)
ok    the feed is check_runs[]
ok    every check run carries a non-empty name (build_checks skips a row with none), conclusion (present, null while unfinished), html_url and app.slug
ok    check-run conclusions are in the vocabulary conclusion_class classifies
ok    every check run carries a check_suite.id (build_checks reads by name across every suite and provider)
ok    GitHub Actions' own check runs carry app.slug == "github-actions" (providers_are_actions_only's literal)
ok    filter=latest is a subset of filter=all by id (it filters; it does not invent rows)
ok    every check run filter=all has that filter=latest lacks (1, with 0 created between the two reads set aside) is a superseded attempt: a newer row of the same suite and name is in filter=latest (no stale twin, and no uniqueness asked of same-named jobs)
ok    every run row carries a numeric check_suite_id (the join to a check run's check_suite.id)
ok    every github-actions check run of the tip's newest 10 runs is named after a job of ITS run (the advisory deny-list matches JOB names), on 2 check runs
ok    the anchor PR #7 is merged, with a merge_commit_sha, a base.sha, a head.sha and a base.ref
ok    a merged PR's mergeability is not computed: mergeable present and null, mergeable_state 'unknown'
ok    pulls/<n>/commits serves as many rows as the PR's .commits, oldest first, each with a sha and a string commit.message, the last one the PR's head (warn_series_close's shape)
ok    the merge commit's second parent is the PR's head
ok    GitHub's merge commit is committed by noreply@github.com with a verified signature (tip_pr_head_verdict's clean-merge test)
ok    commits/<merge sha>/pulls lists the PR it merged, with merged_at, that merge_commit_sha, its head.sha and base.ref (tip_pr_head_verdict's lookup)
ok    `.base.sha` is a SNAPSHOT, not the base the merge was built on: on #7 it differs from the merge commit's first parent
ok    ... and the snapshot is BEHIND that parent (an ancestor, so 'behind' counts read off it undercount)
ok    compare/<a>...<b>?per_page=1 carries behind_by, ahead_by, merge_base_commit.sha and files[].filename (the drift fixture's shape)
ok    compare files[] rows carry string filename and status, numeric additions, deletions and changes, and previous_filename absent, null or non-empty (valid_file's shape)
ok    on every compare file that carries a patch, its +/- line counts equal additions/deletions (compare_hunks's consistency test)
ok    ... and merge_base_commit is the older side when it is an ancestor
ok    a renamed entry carries previous_filename
ok    pulls?state=closed is a list whose rows carry merged_at (present, null when closed unmerged)
ok    on the 1 most recently merged PRs (of the latest 100 closed), base.sha is the merge's first parent or an ancestor of it — never off the base line
ok    pulls?state=open is a list
ok    every row of the open-PR list carries a numeric number
ok    an open PR's pulls/<n> read carries head.sha, base.ref, updated_at, and mergeable (present) in {true,false,null}
ok    ... and created_at, the review clock's floor, no later than updated_at
ok    ... and a mergeable_state in the vocabulary status_state renders (dirty is CONFLICTS, unknown is not yet computed)
skip  a push made while mergeable_state=dirty gets no pull_request run — needs a dirty PR pushed to under observation; not manufactured here
skip  a push moves the PR's updated_at (the push clock) — push time is not an API field; measured live on ludics-lite#38, not re-checkable without a push
ok    the reactions feed is a list
ok    reactions carry content, user.login and created_at
ok    the app's login carries the [bot] suffix: 'chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]' reacted, and nothing is logged in as bare 'chatgpt-codex-connector'
ok    the approval is a '+1' reaction from the app (the merge gate's 👍)
ok    the issue-comments feed is a list
ok    issue comments carry numeric id, created_at, updated_at, body and user.login
ok    the app's summary comment carries the codex-pull-request-review-summary machine tag
ok    the paginated inline-comments feed is a list
ok    the unpaginated inline-comments read is a list
ok    inline comments carry numeric id, pull_request_review_id, commit_id, the original_commit_id poll stamps and folds by, user.login, a non-empty path, body, and the line/original_line pair poll renders
ok    the reviews feed is a list
ok    reviews carry numeric id, state, commit_id, submitted_at (present, null while pending), user.login and a body (poll renders it)
ok    the app's review states are in the vocabulary (the projections filter to the app before classifying; other participants' states are not read)
ok    a round with findings is COMMENTED reviews from the app, and the approval is NOT an APPROVED review (it is the reaction above)
ok    a reply to an inline comment is a COMMENTED review by the replier in the same feed as the app's rounds (so 'new' must be id > watermark, not a count; review 32 by lukstafi)
skip  the flat listing paginates at 30 by default — #9 has 3 inline comments, not more than a page; a larger anchor shows it
ok    a review's own comments endpoint answers with exactly the flat listing's rows for that review, by id (the merge-by-id read; review 31)
ok    the per-review rows carry what poll renders and folds from this feed alone while the flat listing lags: numeric id and pull_request_review_id, commit_id, the original_commit_id the head stamp needs, the position pair the fold keys on, user.login, a non-empty path, body
ok    every Code Review row of the sampled PRs' summaries is Completed or Failed in the allowlisted shape, or Running, dated by an ISO 8601 UTC datetime not in the future (1 rows on 1 PRs; 0 Failed)
ok    a findings review is submitted before its row flips to Completed: the app's last review naming the newest Completed row's commit is not after that row, on 1 sampled PRs (status_state's 'nothing since the 👀' rests on it, #453)
ok    the gate's own THREADS_QUERY, sent verbatim, answers #9's reviewThreads as a connection: nodes[], a numeric totalCount and a boolean pageInfo.hasNextPage
ok    every thread carries a non-empty node id (resolve's threadId) and isResolved as a boolean (closed only when literally true)
ok    every thread's first comment carries fullDatabaseId as a decimal string (the BigInt THREAD_ID_JQ names a thread by, ahead of databaseId)
ok    databaseId is not clamped past 2^31: on #9's 3 thread(s) whose first comment id is past it, databaseId is null or the very number fullDatabaseId spells (THREAD_ID_JQ's fallback)
ok    on a walk of #9 at 2 a page (2 pages), EVERY page states a numeric totalCount, nodes[] and a boolean hasNextPage, with a non-empty endCursor whenever there is a next page (threads_walk reads the last page's count)
ok    ... and the pages add up: each states the verbatim read's totalCount (3), their rows reach it, and the last says hasNextPage false (threads_walk's whole-read test)
skip  reviewThreads paged past 100 threads — no PR here has more than one page of 100 threads; the paging itself is pinned above on a smaller page of the same query
ok    an unpaginated commits/<sha> read answers ONE default page: 300 of 3333333333333333333333333333333333333333's 301 files (a single read is a truncated diff, which is why commit_files pages, and a list of exactly 300 is what its refusal at 300 catches)
ok    commits/<sha>?per_page=100 under --paginate is one commit object per page with files[], each page 100 rows but the last, which has 1 to 100 (the page size commit_files asks for is honoured)
ok    ... and the joined pages are the WHOLE first-parent diff, past 300: 301 rows with distinct, non-empty string filenames (the read commit_files takes as the commit's changed paths is not capped at the default page)
ok    a renamed row carries a non-empty previous_filename (commit_files lists both names as changed paths)
skip  compare's 300-file cap — no compare of that size exists in this repository
