# The fixture transport the three `pr-review.sh base` suites share, and the wall-clock idiom they

#

# The suites over it, one subject each — `base` was one 900-line, 33-case file carrying the first
# three, where "which suite failed" said only "base":
#
#   test-pr-review-base-red.sh      the RED report: which job failed and where the red started
#                                   (ludics-lite#73, #81)
#   test-pr-review-base-settle.sh   the tip's own ABSENCE: the paths-ignore settle and the one
#                                   absence that is not a race (ludics-lite#156, #163)
#   test-pr-review-base-verdict.sh  what the WAIT LOOP decides: which break ends the wait, what
#                                   each break re-confirms, where the absence clock starts
#                                   (ludics-lite#93)
#   test-pr-review-base-pushless.sh a workflow that no longer runs on push: the tip judged by a
#                                   NAMED source or not at all (ludics-lite#401), and a push
#                                   tip whose own run is in flight: pending, or an interim
#                                   green by the same source under --interim (#308)
#
# What this file provides: the canned answers keyed the way `base` reads them (TIP, WORKFLOWS_JSON,
# RUNS_<id> and its per-round successors, JOBS_<run id>, FILES_<sha initial>, the compare and the
# workflow file), the fixture `gh` that serves them, `reset_fixture` to clear every one of them
# between cases, `run_base` to capture a command's output and status, and the wall-clock idiom
# below.
#
# Executed rather than sourced, it runs its own controls over that transport: the round counter,
# the per-round feed, the delays, the run aged at its read, and the tip move, each read directly
# off the fixture rather than through a `base` run, so they say what the transport does and not
# what the script made of it.

# Executed rather than sourced, this file sources the preamble ITSELF, before it defines anything:
# the preamble refuses a caller that defined functions above it (the shadow in the other
# direction), so its own controls could not otherwise run. Sourced by a suite that skipped the
# preamble it refuses instead, rather than sourcing it from under the suite — a suite's
# definitions belong below both files, and the preamble is the one that can say so.

# One brace group, so bash parses this file WHOLE before its first line runs and an edit landing
# while a run is in flight cannot resume the shell at a shifted offset; the `exit` at the foot
# means the shell never comes back to the file for a next command. Two lines here and two at the
# foot, with the body's own indentation untouched (ludics-lite#10, #247); scripts/check-parse-guards.sh
# checks the shape. Sourced by a sibling suite, the `|| return 0` dispatch below ends the source
# inside the group, before the foot's `exit` is reached, so the caller survives.

# --- the wall-clock idiom (ludics-lite#169, #179, #375) ----------------------------------------
# Some cases here depend on SECONDS: a retuned grace, a `--wait` ceiling, and a delay inside the
# fixture. They are the only cases in this repository whose fixture and whose subject are both on
# the clock, and they went red on a loaded machine twice, then on the Git Bash runner, before
# settling into one shape. It is three rules, and each of them is a thing that failed (a fourth,
# below them, keeps a case that needs an AGE off the clock altogether):
#
#   Put the clock in an explicit DELAY. The grace is spent by `spend_grace <seconds>`, which
#   holds up the round's FIRST read by that much, and never by "however long N rounds take".
#   `CHECKS_INTERVAL=1` makes a round about a second on an idle box and rather more on a busy
#   one, so a case counting rounds against a grace is a case that passes when the box is quiet.
#
#   Put the fixture's EVENTS on ROUNDS, counted. `at_round <n> <sha>` moves the branch and
#   `runs_from_round <n> <id> <runs>` changes a workflow's runs, both on the runs-feed read count,
#   which is one per round by construction. A tip that moved "five rounds in" was once counted in
#   tip READS, of which a round takes one or two, and under load four rounds happened where five
#   were counted on (#169, round 2).
#
#   END a wait that has to reach a round on an EVENT, never on its ceiling. A round on the Git
#   Bash runner — a fixture and several jq.exe spawns — outran the two seconds `--wait=2` was
#   counted on to hold two of them, and a six-second ceiling sized to land after round one landed
#   inside it (#375). So a case that needs round <n> makes round <n> end the wait: a run that
#   completes from then on, a tip that moves, a grace that runs out. Its ceiling is
#   `--wait=$EVENT_CEILING`, a safety net that only a broken case reaches, and its claim about how
#   far the wait got is `rounds_polled`. A case whose ceiling IS its subject (the headline a wait
#   prints when it runs out) asserts only what holds however few rounds fit under it.
#
#   Stamp an AGE at the READ. A case that needs a run of a given age when `base` reads it —
#   just inside a window, just past it — has it stamped by the fixture as it serves the feed
#   (`aged_at_read`), never computed from the case's own clock before `run_base`: the gap between
#   the two is load, and a one-second margin spent by it reads the run on the wrong side. Stamped
#   at the read, an age the script measures at its own snapshot (taken before the read) can only
#   come out at or under the stamp, and one measured after a `delay_after_runs_read` of <d>
#   seconds at or over the stamp plus <d> — whatever the box's load.

# The ceiling of a case that ends its wait on an event: an order of magnitude past the longest
# such case's rounds on the slowest runner, so reaching it says the case is broken, not slow.
EVENT_CEILING=60

# spend_grace <seconds>: hold up the fixture's FIRST read by <seconds>, once. An API round takes
# time, and the grace is measured from when the tip was first READ, so a case that needs the grace
# to expire inside the wait spends it here rather than waiting rounds out. Once, because every

# went red somewhere else; the reset now refuses, naming it. The shape here is the same over a
# constant the script still sets, BUDGET_DIR. The control: names a case creates under the same
