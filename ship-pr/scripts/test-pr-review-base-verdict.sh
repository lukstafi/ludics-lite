# Focused fixture tests for what the WAIT LOOP of `pr-review.sh base --wait` DECIDES, and the swap
# that decides a verdict (ludics-lite#93).
#
# The red-report and settle suites pin the report (#81) and the tip's absence (#156). This one is
# about the VERDICT: which break ends the wait, what each break re-confirms before it trusts what
# it read, where the absence clock starts, and which run in a workflow's window the verdict is
# taken from — the newest JUDGED one, since under cancel-in-progress concurrency the newest
# completed run on a busy default branch is routinely `cancelled`, stopped and not judged.
#
# Every break here re-confirms the tip before it acts, because the branch moves under a wait as a
# matter of course, and a verdict reported for a commit that is no longer the tip is worse than no
# verdict: it sends the caller fixing a fix already in flight, or branching off a green that was
# about the commit before theirs.
#
# The fixture transport is test-pr-review-base-lib.sh, shared with the red-report and settle
# suites (ludics-lite#179). Three cases here are on the clock, and the idiom that keeps them
# honest — `spend_grace`, `at_round` and `runs_from_round`, `rounds_polled`, a wait ended by an
# event under `EVENT_CEILING` — is written down in that file's header.
