# Focused fixture tests for pr-review.sh's polling budget (ludics-lite#543): the pause an observer
# takes between reads, the quota hold every process on the host shares, and the one observer per
# PR. The 2026-10-04 OCANNL wave exhausted the account's REST quota while approved heads waited
# for hosted macOS runners. Each `merge --wait` re-read every minute, a quota 403 ended it with
# exit 3 and its caller armed another, and recovery took a coordinator-wide hold, one observer per
# issue, and 300 s and 600 s polls. The three fixtures the issue names are the acceptance:
#
#   - a quota or transport failure stays UNKNOWN and never permits a merge, and while the hold
#     stands no command calls GitHub at all;
#   - an observer resumes only after a successful request to the endpoint that failed, read from
#     that endpoint's own headers (never /rate_limit), and a second observer of the PR is refused;
#   - a meaningful failure still ends the wait at once, while an unchanged queued poll prints
#     nothing and backs off toward the cap.
#
# The clock is a file: `date +%s` and `sleep` are suite functions that read and advance it, so the
# hold's end, the probes and the pauses are exact, and nothing here sleeps for real. The fixture
# gh answers every request from that clock: before QUOTA_UNTIL, as GitHub answers an exhausted
# quota (a 403 whose first stderr line says so, and `-i` headers naming the reset); after it, as
# the endpoint.
#
# Every case drives a command (ludics-lite#403): the commands are served by Python, which reads the
# clock file as SHIP_PR_TEST_CLOCK and calls the suite's `sleep` through the shell bridge, and the
# hold that stands is read off the state directory, whose format every version on a host shares.
# What no command line reaches (the parse of a run view whose options precede its id, lock_reap's
# race, a write inside an observer's ceiling) is pinned in lib/ludics/tests/test_prreview_budget.py.
