# Focused fixture tests for pr-review.sh's `retry`: the plain retry's line between an answer, a
# caller error and transport, and `retry run watch`'s — how the run is addressed, and the line
# between an invocation error and a verdict about the run (ludics-lite#74).
#
# The await used to resolve the repository from the cwd when no -R/REPO named one. A worker whose
# background shell had started in another project's worktree awaited a run id from this one: the
# read 404'd against the repo the cwd named, and the await exited 1 — a red gate manufactured out
# of a wrong-target invocation. So the run now travels as owner/name#<run-id>, like every other
# subcommand's argument, and the cases below pin BOTH halves: the refusals that replaced the
# guess, and the exits 0/1/3/4 that must survive them (a refusal policy that swallowed the real
# verdicts would be worse than the inference it replaced).
#
# It also pins the plain `retry`'s line between a GraphQL answer and transport (ludics-lite#422): a
# query-cost rejection was retried four times and reported as "the API never answered". The
# fixed-answer bodies below are verbatim from real `gh` 2.101.0 calls; each must exit 1 on its first
# attempt, while a gateway failure and the near-misses outside the allowlist still retry to exit 3.
# And gh's own refusal of a caller's arguments (ludics-lite#452): `gh pr view 1 --json nosuchfield`
# sends nothing, yet was retried four times and reported as exit 3. Those bodies are verbatim too,
# and each must exit 2 on its first attempt, while their near-misses still retry to exit 3 (Cobra's
# flag-syntax and minimum-count refusals joined in ludics-lite#468; the `discussion` path did not). And
# gh refusing an argument the SCRIPT sends (ludics-lite#471: a gh upgrade renaming a field) stops the
# whole command with exit 2, where it used to retry to exit 3 and leave `watch` re-arming forever.

# (ludics-lite#10, #247). The `{` opens BELOW the sources, not above them: bash binds a function's
# `declare -F` location when it PARSES the definition, so inside a group that also holds the
# sources every definition here is parsed first and the libraries' bindings land last -- and the
