# head tally beside it reads nothing the count did not read first, so no feed reaches it alone;
# it is a jq program of the SHELL's review_rounds, which `watch` reads until it is ported, broken
# by name with the preamble's shim (`with_broken_jq`, ludics-lite#179). The count's own arm
# refuses; the tally defaults, and what this pins is that the default is the visible `?` and never
