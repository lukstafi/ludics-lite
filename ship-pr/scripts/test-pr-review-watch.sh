# Fixture tests for what ends a `watch` (ludics-lite#72). The loop used to return 0 on any
# `--- ` line a poll rendered, whoever it was about: on this repository a round's watch exited on
# the inline findings and took its watermark from that poll, the reviewer's separate summary
# review landed seconds later with a higher id, and the NEXT window returned 0 on it at once —
# a wake, a re-arm, and nothing about the new head to act on. So the wait now ends only on
# reviewer activity about the head being watched, every exit says what it is exiting on, and a
# verdict that says nothing came polls once more before it says it.
#
# The `expected` clock is here too, the same issue's other half: it used to start at the head
# commit's committer date alone, which on a PR opened seconds earlier read "due for 22m" and
# recommended a nudge at a reviewer that had had no time at all.
#
# The fixture answers the feeds IN SEQUENCE across polls (see `schedule`), which is what a
# watch-level case needs and what the single-answer suites do not do: the round a final poll
# catches has to be absent from the round before it.
